Simon Taufel points out grave error in giving extra run to England against NZ in WC final,"Five-time ICC umpire of the year award-winning Australian umpire Simon Taufel has pointed out a grave error for awarding six runs to England instead of five in the final of World Cup 2019. Taufel, who is currently a part of the MCC’s laws sub-committee that makes the rules governing cricket, told an Australian based news channel that England should have been awarded five runs, not six. It’s a clear mistake.. it’s an error of judgment, Taufel said. They (England) should have been awarded five runs, not six. Taufel was considered among the best umpires of his time, he also said that tail-ender Adil Rashid should have been on strike for the penultimate delivery of the innings instead of Stokes. It all happened on the fourth delivery of the over when England needed 9 runs to win. Guptill’s threw from the deep hit straight on the willow of Ben Stokes, which went for a boundary. As per law 19.8, pertaining to Overthrow or wilful act of fielder, If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be any runs for penalties awarded to either side, and the allowance for the boundary, and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.

Luck smiles on England as Eoin Morgan lifts World Cup trophy for first time,"LONDON: England made history on Sunday by winning the World Cup 2019 after a thrilling super over at the home of cricket, Lord’s. The underdog New Zealand equalized the total (15 runs) but the Eoin Morgan’s team had its name on the trophy due to scoring more boundaries in their batting innings. Needing to surpass New Zealand´s 241-8 to win the World Cup for the first time, England ended on 241 all out after Mark Wood was run out off the final ball. England was looking to Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler (59) to take them home after New Zealand sparked a top-order collapse but after a 110 runs crucial partnership Butler’s wicket gave a much-needed breakthrough to Willamson. Fergusson and Neesham took three wickets each, while Henry, and Grandhomme picked one wicket each. Three-times losing finalists England were in trouble at 86-4, chasing a target of 242, when Stokes and Buttler joined forces. But with 10 overs left, the host nation had recovered to 170-4, needing a further 72 runs for victory against 2015 runners-up New Zealand, also looking for a maiden World Cup win. Left-handed batsman Stokes, born in Christchurch, New Zealand, but brought up in England, was 43 not out and Buttler 42 not out. Earlier, fast bowler, Liam Plunkett dismissed New Zealand captain and star batsman Kane Williamson for just 30 before removing established opener Henry Nicholls for an innings-best 55 in a return of 3-42 from his 10 overs. Chris Woakes followed up with 3-37 as New Zealand finished on 241-8. New Zealand successfully defended a total of 239 in their shock semi-final win over India, when they reduced one of the world´s strongest batting line-up to 24-4. And Trent Boult almost struck with the first ball of England´s chase when he appealed for lbw against Jason Roy but South African umpire Marais Erasmus´s original not out the decision was upheld. Roy, who made a blistering 85 in a comfortable semi-final win over reigning champions Australia, got England going with a straight-driven four off Matt Henry. Roy and Jonny Bairstow, by average the best opening pair in one-day international history, had posted four consecutive century stands coming into the final. Early breakthrough
But New Zealand got the breakthrough they needed when Henry induced Roy, on 17, to edge a full-length delivery that just carried to wicketkeeper Tom Latham. That left England , who thrashed New Zealand by 119 runs in a group match, 28-1 in the sixth over. New batsman Joe Root never looked comfortable while making seven off 30 balls and was caught behind to leave England 59-2. Bairstow had enjoyed a huge reprieve on 18 when Colin de Grandhomme dropped a routine caught-and-bowled chance but fast bowler Lockie Ferguson got him to play on for 36. Jimmy Neesham took a wicket with his first ball, with England captain Eoin Morgan falling for just nine when an uppercut was brilliantly caught low down by Ferguson running in from deep point. But Stokes and Buttler revived England with some well-struck boundaries. Williamson chose to bat after winning the toss in overcast conditions and on a green pitch but opener Martin Guptill, the leading run-scorer at the 2015 World Cup, was lbw to Woakes for 19. That left number three Williamson, who started the match with 548 runs in the tournament at an average of 91.33, having to mount yet another rescue mission. But after putting on 74 for the second wicket with Nicholls, he fell when he edged a rising cross-seamer from Plunkett to wicketkeeper Buttler. New Zealand found themselves 118-3 when Plunkett struck for the second time in 14 balls. Nicholls, who had completed a 71-ball fifty, was out for 55 when he played on after being cramped for room by a Plunkett delivery that curved back into him and veteran Ross Taylor could only manage 15 before falling lbw to Mark Wood. Latham defiantly hit Wood for six but his valuable 47 off 56 balls ended when he chipped a low Woakes full toss to mid-off.

World Cup Final: New Zealand sets a mild target of 242 runs for England,"LONDON: New Zealand, in World Cup 2019 finale on Sunday, set a mild target of 242 runs for host England here at Lord’s, London. Henry Nicholls, with 55 runs, and Tom Latham with 47 runs remained the only Kiwi top scorers of the day. Followed by skipper Kane Williamson with 30 runs. Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett dismissed three Englishmen each while Jofra Archer and Mark Wood both took one wicket each. When England exited the 2015 edition with an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh, few were tipping them as potential champions in four years’ time. As England captain Eoin Morgan put it, If you had offered us the position to play in a final the day after we were knocked out of the 2015 World Cup, I would have laughed at you. One person not laughing was Andrew Strauss, the former England director of cricket. Drafted into the newly created role, Strauss set about an overhaul that saw the former England captain appoint Australia’s Trevor Bayliss as coach, and place greater emphasis on white-ball cricket. The worth of all that work showed when Morgan’s men, now top of the one-day international rankings, thrashed reigning champions Australia by eight wickets in the semi-final at Edgbaston on Thursday. Many of the elements that made England the pre-tournament favourites were on show in Birmingham. Pacemen Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes reduced Australia to 14-3, leg-spinner Adil Rashid took wickets in the middle and the dynamic duo of Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow — statistically the most successful opening pair in ODI history — launched the run chase with a blistering century partnership. ‘Fearless’ cricket  The challenge for England is to embrace the hype surrounding Sunday’s fixture without letting it inhibit them from playing their brand of fearless cricket. By reaching the final, England have guaranteed an international match will be shown live on free-to-air television in Britain for the first time since the iconic 2005 Ashes series — a chance to inspire a new generation. I think Sunday’s not a day to shy away from, it’s a day to look forward to, said Morgan, an outrider in English cricket in becoming an ODI specialist when the steely Dubliner realised his Test career had stalled. It is perhaps appropriate that England are facing New Zealand in a final between two sides who have yet to win the World Cup. For it was the Black Caps who showed England how to play the modern one-day game at the 2015 edition in Wellington four years ago. They shot out England for just 123 and then overhauled that total in a mere 12.2 overs. It was as close to rock-bottom as I’ve been, said Morgan. Certainly as a captain and as a player, being beaten off the park like that was humiliating. England gained a measure of revenge with a 119-run thrashing of New Zealand in a group-stage match earlier in this World Cup. But that is unlikely to count for much on Sunday. All tournament long, the same comment has been made about New Zealand — they boast a well-balanced attack led by left-arm quick Trent Boult but are over-reliant on captain Kane Williamson and fellow senior batsman Ross Taylor for their runs. The polite Kiwis have responded by continuing to scrap, in the phrase of fast bowler Lockie Ferguson, their way to wins as demonstrated by their dramatic 18-run semi-final victory over India. Boult and Matt Henry reduced one of the world’s most powerful top orders to 5-3, before left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, aided by superb fielding, backed them up after Williamson and Taylor had made battling fifties on a tricky pitch. While many members of the home side were not even born when England made the last of three losing appearances in a World Cup final in 1992, the Black Caps have the experience of their heavy defeat by co-hosts Australia in the climax of the 2015 edition in Melbourne to call on. I’d be lying if I said we weren’t a bit overawed by the change of scenery, said Taylor as he looked back to New Zealand’s first and only match on Australian soil in that tournament. I think we know what to expect, the pressures that come with it, we’ve been there before. You just have to enjoy it, it’s the ‘Home of Cricket’, I can’t think of a better place to play a final.

"World Cup Final: England, New Zealand clash to claim golden trophy today","LONDON: England face New Zealand in the World Cup final today knowing years of planning come down to a single day at Lord’s.

Jason Roy cleared to play World Cup final despite umpire outburst,"BIRMINGHAM: England star Jason Roy has been cleared to play in Sunday’s World Cup final against New Zealand despite showing dissent at an umpire’s decision while helping the hosts book their place in the showpiece match. The Surrey opener had made 85 to set England well on their way to an eventual eight-wicket against Australia in Thursday’s semi-final at Edgbaston when he was given out caught behind down the legside off fast bowler Pat Cummins by Sri Lankan umpire Kumar Dharmasena. Roy requested a review but England had already squandered their lone review of the innings with an unsuccessful attempt to overturn fellow opener Jonny Bairstow´s lbw dismissal for 34. Nevertheless, Dharmasena confusingly and incorrectly signalled for a review, with Australia pointing out the official’s mistake. Roy, his arms spread wide, clearly believed Dharmasena should have signalled a wide delivery instead and the furious batsman had to be ushered away from the crease by square leg umpire Marais Erasmus. Eventually, a clearly unhappy Roy, whose tirade prompted television broadcasters to apologise for his foul language, made his way back to the pavilion, with England 147 for two in the 20th over. Roy, who admitted the offence, was fined 30 per cent of his match fee for breaching that section of the International Cricket Council’s code of conduct that prohibits showing dissent at an umpire’s decision. The 28-year-old also received two demerit points from match referee Ranjan Madugalle, taking his tally for the tournament to three following a one-point penalty he received for an audible obscenity after dropping a catch in a group-stage match against Pakistan. But match bans only kick in when a player collects four demerit points in total leaving Roy, a key figure in Eoin Morgan’s side, available to feature as England bid to win the World Cup for the first time.

England makes into final of World Cup after 27 years by thrashing Aussies,"BIRMINGHAM: England beat Australia in second Semi- final to make their place into World Cup final after the wait of 27 years. Last time they made into finals playing against Imran Khan led Pakistan team in 1992 where they suffered defeat. Eoin Morgan´s side ended Australia´s bid to retain the World Cup in ruthless fashion at Edgbaston, dismissing their old rivals for 223 and then powering to victory in 32.1 overs thanks to Jason Roy´s blistering 85. England will head to Lord´s bidding to win the 50-over World Cup for the first time, with 2015 runners-up New Zealand, who they thrashed by 119 runs in the group stage, standing between Morgan´s men and the trophy. England, who were in the semi-finals for the first time since 1992, have lost all three of their World Cup finals. The most recent of those painful defeats came in 1992 when Graham Gooch´s side were beaten by Pakistan, while Australia in 1987 and the West Indies in 1979 have also denied England in the final. Australia´s first-ever World Cup semi-final defeat, after seven previous victories at this stage, shattered the five-time champions´ hopes of reaching the final for the sixth time in the past seven editions. While Australia lick their wounds before facing England in the Ashes next month, the progress of Morgan´s team comes after a four-year overhaul. England´s woeful first-round exit at the 2015 World Cup prompted a root-and-branch reform of their approach to one-day internationals for a side that had long placed Test success above all other considerations. Australian coach Trevor Bayliss was drafted in, sparking an impressive transformation that has seen England climb to number one in the ODI rankings and move to within touching distance of World Cup glory.

Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid both dismissed three Englishmen while Jofra Archer and Mark Wood got two and one wicket respectively. Australia, in the second semi-final clash, opted to bat first against England here at Edgbaston, Birmingham on Thursday. Four years of planning will be put on the line for England when they face holders Australia in a blockbuster World Cup semi-final at Edgbaston today. England’s woeful first-round exit at the 2015 edition prompted a complete rethink of their approach to one-day internationals for a side that had long placed Test success above all other considerations. Australian coach Trevor Bayliss was drafted in with the aim of guiding their bid for a first World Cup title. The transformation has been impressive, with England climbing to number one in the ODI rankings under the astute captaincy of Eoin Morgan. Their rise to the summit has been based on dynamic run-scoring, with in-form openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow leading the way. But the stakes for hosts England are higher than simply the winning of a match that would see them into a final against New Zealand at Lord´s on Sunday. Host broadcaster Sky has said it will allow the final to be shown on free-to-air television in Britain — but only if England are involved in the showpiece match. It would be the first time since 2005 that a major England men’s home match had emerged from behind a UK television paywall, with cricket having a chance to reconnect with a ‘lost’ audience in its birthplace. But Morgan urged England to avoid being overawed by the scale of the task confronting them in Birmingham. Sometimes I’m guilty of it, you can lose sight of the position you´re in and the fact you´re living your dream, Morgan said on Wednesday. Australia, however, have never lost any of their seven previous World Cup semi-finals — although they did tie with South Africa at Edgbaston 20 years ago before advancing into the final thanks to their superior net run-rate from the preceding ‘Super Six’ stage. England had won 10 of their last 11 ODIs against Australia prior to the World Cup. But that counted for nothing when Australia landed a psychological blow in the group stage, beating Ashes rivals England by 64 runs at Lord´s last month. Australia left-arm quicks Jason Behrendorff and Mitchell Starc shared nine wickets between them in a match where Australia captain Aaron Finch made 100 after surviving a testing opening from England´s fast bowlers. ‘Different team’ Roy, however, was missing with a torn hamstring and since his return, England have secured crucial wins over India and New Zealand that took them into the semi-finals. We’re probably more confident than we were three games ago, we’re a different team, Morgan said. It feels like we´re back to the team we are. Meanwhile, Australia, who have not won in any format at Edgbaston since the 2001 Ashes Test, suffered a surprise 10-run defeat by South Africa at Old Trafford in their final group game. England, as well as finding a way to cope with Starc, will have to contain the run-scoring threat of a powerful Australian top order. David Warner has scored 638 runs this tournament following the left-handed opener’s return to international cricket after a 12-month ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. But they will be without Usman Khawaja after the batsman suffered a tournament-ending hamstring injury against South Africa, while speculation about Glenn Maxwell’s place intensified when the struggling all-rounder did not attend training on Wednesday. It’s a purely optional training session, you’re reading a bit too much into it, said Finch on Wednesday when asked about Maxwell, who has scored just 155 runs in nine innings. Australia are bidding for a sixth World Cup title, having won four of the last five editions. We’re full of confidence going into this game, but England have been front runners in one-day cricket for the last four years, said opener Finch.

Australian coach Trevor Bayliss was drafted in with the aim of guiding their bid for a first World Cup title. The transformation has been impressive, with England climbing to number one in the ODI rankings under the astute captaincy of Eoin Morgan. Their rise to the summit has been based on dynamic run-scoring, with in-form openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow leading the way. But the stakes for hosts England are higher than simply the winning of a match that would see them into a final against New Zealand at Lord´s on Sunday. Host broadcaster Sky has said it will allow the final to be shown on free-to-air television in Britain — but only if England are involved in the showpiece match. It would be the first time since 2005 that a major England men’s home match had emerged from behind a UK television paywall, with cricket having a chance to reconnect with a ‘lost’ audience in its birthplace. But Morgan urged England to avoid being overawed by the scale of the task confronting them in Birmingham. Sometimes I’m guilty of it, you can lose sight of the position you´re in and the fact you´re living your dream, Morgan said on Wednesday. Australia, however, have never lost any of their seven previous World Cup semi-finals — although they did tie with South Africa at Edgbaston 20 years ago before advancing into the final thanks to their superior net run-rate from the preceding ‘Super Six’ stage. England had won 10 of their last 11 ODIs against Australia prior to the World Cup. But that counted for nothing when Australia landed a psychological blow in the group stage, beating Ashes rivals England by 64 runs at Lord´s last month. Australia left-arm quicks Jason Behrendorff and Mitchell Starc shared nine wickets between them in a match where Australia captain Aaron Finch made 100 after surviving a testing opening from England´s fast bowlers. ‘Different team’ Roy, however, was missing with a torn hamstring and since his return, England have secured crucial wins over India and New Zealand that took them into the semi-finals. We’re probably more confident than we were three games ago, we’re a different team, Morgan said. It feels like we´re back to the team we are. Meanwhile, Australia, who have not won in any format at Edgbaston since the 2001 Ashes Test, suffered a surprise 10-run defeat by South Africa at Old Trafford in their final group game. England, as well as finding a way to cope with Starc, will have to contain the run-scoring threat of a powerful Australian top order. David Warner has scored 638 runs this tournament following the left-handed opener’s return to international cricket after a 12-month ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. But they will be without Usman Khawaja after the batsman suffered a tournament-ending hamstring injury against South Africa, while speculation about Glenn Maxwell’s place intensified when the struggling all-rounder did not attend training on Wednesday. It’s a purely optional training session, you’re reading a bit too much into it, said Finch on Wednesday when asked about Maxwell, who has scored just 155 runs in nine innings. Australia are bidding for a sixth World Cup title, having won four of the last five editions. We’re full of confidence going into this game, but England have been front runners in one-day cricket for the last four years, said opener Finch. It will come down to whoever holds their nerve and whoever holds their half-chances. AFP.

"World Cup: Semi-final to resume today between India, New Zealand","MANCHESTER: The semi-final clash between New Zealand and India will resume on Wednesday after rain halted the match on Tuesday with Kiwis scoring 211 with 5 wickets down. Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor scored 67 runs while Indian bowlers all got one wicket each. After weeks of close encounters and edge of the seat thrillers, India will take on New Zealand in the first semi-final of the World Cup at Old Trafford in Manchester on Tuesday. Today’s contest will be a repeat of the semi-finals of the 2008 ICC Under-19 World Cup in which a Virat Kohli-led India defeated a Kane Williamson-captained New Zealand in Kuala Lumpur. India, whose group match against 2015 runners-up New Zealand was washed out, have suffered just one defeat at this World Cup so far, against England, and ended on top of the 10-team group stage, making them strong favourites to beat the Black Caps. The Kiwis who were deemed favourites at the start of the tournament kicked off their World Cup campaign on a high, but suffered defeats and only qualified for the semi-finals in fourth place on the basis of net run-rate. They lost their last three games — against Pakistan, holders Australia and England. For New Zealand, skipper Williamson has been in fine form, making match-winning hundreds against South Africa and the West Indies. But the rest of the top order have had a largely forgettable World Cup, with the Black Caps losing 13 wickets in the powerplay at just 23.38 each — the worst record in the competition. Williamson’s 481 tournament runs represent nearly 29 per cent of New Zealand’s total at this World Cup. On the other hand, India’s success at this World Cup has been built on the heavy scoring of a Rohit Sharma-led batting top order. Sharma became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single World Cup when he made 103 in a seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka at Headingley on Saturday, while fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been the spearhead of a well-balanced bowling attack.

1992 vs 2019 World Cup: Memes played crucial part in keeping hopes alive for Pakistani fans,"BY: Maryam Qureshi Rollercoaster ride it has been for Pakistan’s cricket team. ‘Unpredictable’ is the term locals use to define this team and no doubt they are unpredictable, from turning an easy target by taking it to 6 on 6. Exactly when everything was taking a turn so did social media posts, from bashing Sarfaraz Ahmed about his unfit body to scolding Shoaib Malik on eating burgers, now all limelight was being shifted to the similarities between the pattern of 1992’s World Cup and 2019’s. Now that Pakistan is officially disqualified from 2019 World Cup I will shed some light on how meme game took turns. Fans started to take notes of the eerie similarities between 1992 and 2019’s World Cup regarding Pakistan’s pattern of losing and wining. Within a day my Facebook feed was flooding with posts saying ‘Ye World Cup humara’   People linking the similarities in every way they could, however failing to realize cricket game is not merely about repeating past events in favor of a team. If this would have been the case, everyday would be the same as Sun rises and Moon sets in a similar pattern and anyone could have said ‘Oh the Moon also rose in the same manner as yesterday, hence this day will exactly be same like yesterday’s .’ But this is not the case, no one can stay dependent on past events. Pakistan started performing well while beating New Zealand, from 6th ranking Pakistan was now on 4th and how could fans resist from making memes. The ‘men in green’ were proud, all hail to Babar Azam’s outstanding performance. Here is a link to one such meme which made me laugh.  During the very match a comparison was also broadcasted between Pakistan’s pattern of winning and losing in 1992 and 2019, well then the picture got clearer that fans were not only noticing but well known commentators were also well aware of this spooky similarity. This too was turned into a hilarious meme.    Have you ever noticed Pakistan’s cricket fans supporting India? NO. But the entire nation was found hooting for India’s win when Pakistan’s access into Semi-Finals was dependent on their victory. I was shopping with my mother while I overheard a few shopkeepers talking ‘Dua kero India jeet jae achay margin se’ Well, this time I wasn’t shocked as we were depending on India for our ticket to semi final. Right when India’s team was not only being supported by their country but by the neighboring country too, Indian players ‘intentionally lost the match’ as said by many Pakistani cricket fans. Batsmen were seen brisk walking on the pitch while making singles and no doubt their actions were clear. Relying on a rival for a gesture which could get Pakistani team into semis was not a good option. India lost and meme generators were active again (Well.. they are never inactive)   This meme showing M.S Dhoni holding a banner saying ‘Apna game khud jeeto’  It might be funny for some and thought to provoke for many. If Pakistani players performed well in past matches then waiting for India’s win would not have been a matter of concern for Pakistani fans. One must understand, Pakistan getting into Finals should not be reliant on India’s performance or the past performances in 1992. In 1992 Imran Khan was the captain whereas in 2019 Sarfaraz Ahmed is the captain. Khan married thrice doesn’t mean that Ahmed would too similarly pattern of winning or losing could have been noticed till generating memes but not for a country’s winning or losing probability. Game is all about losing and winning, I have said this before and I will say it again ‘Tum jeeto ya haaro suno, humein tumse pyar hai’  Long way to go green shirts, I will support you but I would also like to add the fact that if Pakistan’s run rate was maintained at a better number, we might have been a part of Semis Or Finals as players and not as audience.

Mixed feelings for Mickey Arthur as Pakistan out of World Cup,"Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur admitted his side’s failed World Cup campaign left him with mixed feeling as they crashed out despite beating Bangladesh by 94 runs on Friday. To reach the semi-finals, Pakistan needed to rewrite the record books with the biggest margin of victory in a one-day international. But they came up short as their 315-9 meant Bangladesh had to be bowled out for just eight at Lord’s. That impossible task was quickly put to bed as Bangladesh reached eight runs in the second over, allowing New Zealand to join Australia, India and England into the semi-finals. Pakistan secured 11 points in nine games, as many as New Zealand scored, but were ousted on an inferior net run-rate. Arthur, whose contract with Pakistan ends after the tournament, said it was a disappointing conclusion to a campaign that had plenty of highs and lows. It hasn’t ended as we would have liked to have ended it. It’s been a campaign of ifs and buts, Arthur told reporters. If we have a look through our first five games and we have a look through our last five, it’s a campaign of two halves, which has been disappointing. Pakistan had just one win, against hosts England, from five games with three defeats, including a loss to arch rivals India, and a no-result. Inspirational Sarfaraz –
They staged a comeback by winning the next four games but still failed to qualify. Arthur said the task of achieving a huge win against Bangladesh was targeted at the start but became impossible due to the slowness of the pitch. I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a discussion. We won the toss, which was a good start. Getting 400 is a platform. The message we got from Fakhar (Zaman) when he came back in the change room was it was slow and tough to score, Arthur said. Arthur admitted a seven-wicket defeat against the West Indies in the first game hurt his team badly. If we go back, the West Indies game, the first game of the tournament, when you lose like we lost, it’s almost impossible to get back on net run rate, that was disappointing, said Arthur. Arthur labelled his team’s wins over semi-finalists England and New Zealand as the main highlights. It’s nice to sit here and know we’ve beaten two of those top four teams during our campaign, which shows we are not a mile off in terms of where we are as a cricket team, he said. Arthur praised Pakistan skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed for helping the resurgence after being severely criticised for the India defeat. I must say that I’d just like to credit the captain, Sarfaraz. What he was exposed to after the Indian game was atrocious as a Pakistan cricket captain, as any captain of any cricket team, he said. The way he held his composure, the way he led from the front, the way his work ethic never, ever changed. I think he’s been an inspiration to that dressing room, and I think Sarfaraz deserves a lot of credit for this.

World Cup 2019: Pakistan defeats Bangladesh by 94 runs,"LONDON: Pakistan, in their last World Cup 2019 match on Friday, defeated Bangladesh by 94 runs here at Lord’s, London. Shaheen Shah Afridi took 6 wickets and sabotaged Bengal Tigers batting line up. Shadab Khan took two wickets while Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz took one wicket each. Shakib Al Hassan, with 64 runs, remained the only top scorer of Bangladesh who got restricted to 221. Pakistan team hopes to qualify for Semi-Finals vanishes before the match could come to an end as the green shirts managed to score 315 which means Bangladesh has to be bowled out for seven runs, which is seemingly out of the equation. Captain Sarfaraz Ahmed who said in the press conference, a day earlier that Pakistan was looking to score five hundred against the Bengali tigers but his team played with the intent of scoring runs between 300to 320 from the outset. Imam Ul-Haq scored his first century at the World Cup marking an end to his tournament followed by 96 runs scored by Babar Azam. Captain Sarfaraz Ahmed was retired hurt as he came in between the shot hit by Imad Wasim– the ball hitting his elbow. A win for Pakistan can bring them equal to New Zealand but despite the same points, Pakistan will not qualify for Semi-Finals due to the low run rate.

FM Qureshi briefs Saudi counterpart on Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Friday briefed his Saudi Arabian counterpart on India’s unilateral actions in occupied Kashmir, which remains under lockdown since August 5 when the Indian government revoked its special status. In a telephonic conversation with Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Ibrahim bin Abdulaziz Al-Assaf, Qureshi shed light on the ongoing atrocities perpetrated by Indian troops against residents of occupied Kashmir, and said India wanted to forcefully change the demographic composition of the Muslim-majority valley. The Pakistani foreign minister urged the international community to play its role to stop the human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. He said the world media was continuously bringing to fore the Indian oppression, and human rights organisations around the world had condemned India’s actions and expressed fears of ethnic cleansing of the Kashmiri people.  Qureshi further said the people in occupied Kashmir were facing critical shortage of food and medicines due to the strict curfew. He added that the Indian forces were barging into the houses of civilians and detaining the Kashmiri youth. The Saudi foreign minister expressed concern on the crisis in occupied Kashmir, and agreed on the need to continue contact between the two countries for regional peace.

‘The world is silent’: Villagers in AJK’s Chakothi tired of living dangerously along the LoC,"Villagers in Chakothi in Azad Jammu and Kashmir are frustrated with living in constant fear of fighting along the heavily militarised Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Himalayan region. Their situation has been exacerbated since India’s government, led by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, imposed a security lockdown and communications blackout just over the frontier from Chakothi in Indian-occupied Kashmir, which is majority Muslim. The move followed the Indian government’s August 5 decision to downgrade the region’s autonomy, raising tensions with Islamabad and touching off anger in occupied Kashmir. India has been killing our brothers and sisters in Indian-occupied Kashmir and the world is silent, 65-year-old Mohammad Nazir Minhas told reporters on Thursday. It compels us to say that freedom will come only through war. We are ready. Journalists were escorted to the village in AJK by the military to show them the plight of villagers living along the LoC. From where Minhas stood, an Indian post could be seen without using binoculars. India on Thursday said it has information that Pakistan is trying to infiltrate terrorists into the country to carry out attacks amid rising tensions between the two countries. Pakistan Army spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor rejected the Indian claims, saying Pakistan was a responsible state and we would be insane to allow infiltration across the LoC. Minhas, who said he lost his daughter in 1971 when she was shot in the chest by a soldier firing from the Indian side, is among local residents who say they often spend sleepless nights because of nearby skirmishes between Pakistani and Indian forces. The restrictions on occupied Kashmir have been easing slowly, with some businesses reopening, some landline phone service restored and some grade schools holding classes again, though student and teacher attendance has been sparse.

But tensions between India and Pakistan are high. Even last night, there was an intense exchange of fire here, said Mohammad Salman, 75, a Chakothi resident as he stood in the middle of a deserted market. The market stands about 200 metres from the region’s Friendship Bridge, which was opened for a much-awaited bus service in 2005. Pakistan suspended the bus service and trade with India in response to the August 5 changes to Kashmir’s status by New Delhi. The government has also expelled the Indian ambassador and closed train service to and from India. The government has indicated it may soon also close its airspace for Indian overflights, forcing them to take longer routes. Residents of AJK hail these measures, but they complain the government never constructed community bunkers to protect them from gunfire from the Indian side. When our children go out to play, we don’t know whether they will come back alive as India opens fire ruthlessly, said Mohammad Sajid, 45, as he stood at a nearby mosque. Girls make their way back home from school near the LoC in Chakothi sector, in AJK on Thursday. — AFP
Authorities say mortar fired across the LoC struck a home in the village of Kail a day before, killing three civilians. The Pakistan Army says it only returns fire when there is a ceasefire violation by India. Our response is always measured and we only target those Indian posts from where fire hits our civilian population, Maj Gen Ghafoor told reporters. He said Pakistani troops cannot ruthlessly return fire like the Indians do because it could cause civilian casualties on the other side of Kashmir where divided families live. India accuses Pakistan of training and arming insurgent groups that have been fighting since 1989 for Kashmir’s independence from India or its merger with Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies. Pakistan says it only provides moral and diplomatic support to these groups. Most Kashmiris support the demand that the territory be united either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country, while also participating in civilian street protests against Indian control. Villagers at Chakothi say they are waiting for the time when they will ruin the Line of Control to hoist Pakistan’s flag in Srinagar, the main city in occupied Kashmir.

Unprecedented: All three judges hearing PML(N) leaders cases repatriated,"ISLAMABAD: Unprecedented, Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) court judge Masood Arshad stopped himself from the hearing Rana Sanaullah’s case midway on Wednesday after learning that he had been repatriated back to the Lahore High Court (LHC). It emerged that a notification from the Ministry of Law and Justice, dated August 26, had recalled three accountability judges; Masood, judge Mushtaq Ilahi, and judge Muhammad Naeem Arshad. All three judges were hearing anti-graft cases against Hamza Shehbaz, Maryam Nawaz and Rana Sanaullah. Judge Naeem Arshad was the duty judge currently presiding over the Chaudhry Sugar Mills case against Maryam Nawaz and her cousin Yousuf Abbas; the Ramzan Sugar Mills case against Shehbaz Sharif; and money laundering cases against Hamza Shahbaz and Salman Shehbaz. He had been tasked with hearing these cases as the main judge was on summer holidays. No reason has been mentioned in the order. I have just received a Whatsapp message, the Lahore High Court has repatriated me. I cannot lend my expertise to this case any more, judge Masood Arshad said during today’s hearing against Rana Sanaullah. The counsel for Rana Sanaullah, while talking to the media outside the court, said that this [development] was unprecedented. It seems like the government is trying to decide which judge they want the verdict from, he alleged. He said that arguments had concluded in the case when the government decided to withdraw the judge through a notification. PML-N Spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb also criticised the development and termed it as a direct attack on the freedom of judiciary. Those who had made the case up against Rana Sanaullah could not bring a single piece of evidence against him, so they did this instead, she said.

Iran’s Rouhani tells US to lift sanctions first then talk,"TEHRAN: President Hassan Rouhani Tuesday told the United States to take the first step by lifting all sanctions against Iran, a day after US President Donald Trump said he was open to meeting. The step is to retreat from sanctions. You must retreat from all illegal, unjust and wrong sanctions against the nation of Iran, Rouhani said in a speech aired live on state television. He said the key for positive change is in the hands of Washington, because Iran had already ruled out ever doing what worries the US the most — building an atomic bomb. If honestly, this is your only concern, this concern has already been removed through a fatwa issued by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he said. Khamenei is said to have issued a fatwa against nuclear weapons in 2003 and has reiterated it several times since. So take the first step.

"Continue fight for freedom, Gilani’s message to Kashmiri people","Chairman of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, Syed Ali Gilani has appealed to the people of occupied Kashmir to continue their resistance against Indian brutality without losing courage. Gilani, in his first statement received by Kashmir Media Service from house arrest since the abolishing of occupied Kashmir’s special status by India on August 5, said there is no other alternative but to fight. India should know that even if they bring their entire armed forces into occupied Jammu and Kashmir, even then the people of Jammu and Kashmir will not abandon struggle for their rights and liberation. We must fight the enemy in unison. History remains witness to the fact that big military powers have repeatedly perished in front of the force of peoples’ unity and truth. Courage, patience, and discipline are those weapons of a defenseless people which can defeat the enemy with howsoever enormous an arsenal, he wrote. The APHC chairman decried that the entire region has been transformed into a prison. Even as we continue to receive immensely grim news from every corner, the Indian State has made extensive efforts to hide their campaign of brutal repression from the outside world. Not only have they blocked the entire communication systems used by common people since about the beginning of the month, they have also gagged local reportage and news media without any formal declaration. No news about the brutalities and repression of the Indian armed forces, killings, and arrests of thousands of youth is being published. Common people are unable to know about their kith and kin. The oppressors might try to hide the reality, but history will not spare anyone. He wrote, in spite of India’s best efforts, the Kashmir issue is being highlighted throughout the world like never before. The recently concluded United Nations Security Council meeting on Kashmir as well as the international media coverage are its clear examples. In this scenario, we hope that this message reaches you via the international media. He added, This is a great victory for us that now no narrative apart from our ideals of the struggle for self-determination and justice remain relevant in the Kashmiri political discourse. Even those who would never tire of flaunting their pro-India credentials and ties to the Indian system have realized that the Indian State does not care about the lives of Kashmiri people, but is only interested in occupying our land whatsoever the cost. Gilani urged the Kashmiri people living outside occupied Kashmir to keep themselves informed of the situation back home. They must participate in the resistance struggle by acting as ambassadors of Kashmiri people all over the world. They should use their knowledge of Kashmir’s history and their own lived experiences to highlight the oppression and brutalities of the Indian State. They should also connect with other marginalized and struggling nationalities in other parts of the world and forge solidarities of resistance. The leader also appealed to Pakistan, and the Muslim Ummah in general, to come forward at this crucial juncture to help the besieged people of Kashmir. You are an important party to the Kashmir dispute and this is the time for unity and action. Today, if you once again get ensconced in so-called pragmatism and fail to act decisively, then neither history will forgive you nor will your coming generations. You must continue to heighten your political and diplomatic initiatives to the highest level and respond to the deceit of the Indian occupation with full strength and determination.

Modi awarded highest civilian award by UAE,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi received the United Arab Emirates’ highest civilian honour during a visit on Saturday to the oil-rich Gulf nation, reinforcing ties between the countries even as he faces criticism over stripping occupied Kashmir of its autonomy. The induction of Modi into the Order of Zayed shows the importance the UAE places on India, the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil. India is home to a rapidly growing consumer market and labor pool that the federation of sheikhdoms relies on for its own economy. Activists, however, decried the UAE bestowing the award on Modi as he pursues a clampdown on the Himalayan region, saying it only gives cover to India amid the Kashmir crackdown. With several Gulf states in an ever-tightening embrace with Modi, human rights have been discarded in favour of economic opportunities, wrote Samah Hadid, a Beirut-based human rights advocate. India has not only escaped international condemnation for its actions, it is even shoring up support from Muslim allies, said Hadid. The plight of Kashmiris will not only be silenced by India’s clampdown but also the apathy of those who long claimed to speak for them. Modi is also to travel to Bahrain to become the first Indian premier to visit the island nation. Abu Dhabi’s powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, personally put the golden medal around Modi’s neck during an event that was closed to press in Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital. With a portrait of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE’s first president for whom the order is named, behind them, the two men shook and held hands for a moment and spoke quietly. You deserve it, Sheikh Mohammed told Modi at one point while posing for photos. Modi had been announced as a recipient of the prize in April in a tweet from Sheikh Mohammed. We have historical and comprehensive strategic ties with India, reinforced by the pivotal role of my dear friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who gave these relations a big boost, a tweet from his account read. Sheikh Mohammed’s announcement came just before Modi won re-election. Their interaction on Twitter and elsewhere shows the personal relationship the two men have forged, said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political science professor. We’ve never had it like this before, Abdulla said. From there, everything circles down. Related: Modi breaks protocol to greet UAE Crown Prince at airport Even without the personal touch, India has for decades been a major point of trade for the Emirates, from trade routes to gold smuggling. Some 3.1 million Indians now call the UAE home alone, ranging from labourers to multimillionaires, according to Indian government statistics. By comparison, estimates suggest there are only around 1 million Emiratis living in the country of over 9 million. Across the wider Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes six Gulf Arab nations, there are 8.5 million Indians. They send billions of dollars a year in remittances back home. That, coupled with cooperation on political and defense matters, makes India ever-more important for the UAE and other Gulf Arab states. Countries like India cannot be taken for granted anymore, said Kabir Taneja, an associate fellow at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank. The timing of the award, however, comes amid Modi’s push in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. On August 5, Modi’s government revoked a decades-old special status granted to occupied Kashmir and deployed thousands of troops the region. Indian-occupied Kashmir has been under a sweeping military curfew since then that has seen thousands detained and residents cut off from all communication and the internet. Although Modi’s decision affects Muslims living in Indian-occupied Kashmir, the move has drawn a largely muted response from Gulf Arab nations. The UAE’s ambassador to India in particular referred to Kashmir as an internal issue for India. While calling the timing of the award awkward, Abdulla, the Emirati professor, said it made sense for the UAE to honour its promise to give Modi the Order of Zayed. No matter what you do, no matter one way or the other, there’s going to be people who criticise it, he said. Others, like British parliamentarian Naz Shah from the Labour party, see it far differently. She published an open letter addressed to Sheikh Mohammed asking him to reconsider giving the award due to the brutality she described Modi as directing. I ask you to question this decision and reconsider giving such an award, not only because the majority of the Kashmiri people share the same faith as you, but because we have a duty as human beings to stand up against the disregard of human rights and evil, Shah wrote.

Pakistan done very little in terrorism fight: Trump,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that other countries must assume the battle against Islamic extremist militant groups as the US negotiates a withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The Trump administration has reduced the US military presence in Syria and Iraq and is negotiating a US withdrawal from Afghanistan with the Taliban insurgents. But defence experts warn that a vacuum left by the United States could allow an extremist resurgence. A recent Pentagon report said that the IS is reforming and launching attacks after losing their hold on physical territory in Iraq and Syria. Trump, meanwhile, assailed France and Germany for not repatriating citizens who had fought with Islamic state and are now being held in camps in Syria. We’re holding thousands of ISIS fighters right now. And Europe has to take them, he said. If Europe doesn’t take them, I’ll have no choice but to release them into the countries from which they came. Which is Germany and France and other places. We captured them, we’ve got thousands of them, and now as usual our allies don’t want ’em, he said.

Brazil’s president blames NGOs for Amazon fire,"SAO PAULO: Brazil’s right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday accused non-governmental organisations of setting wildfires in the Amazon rainforest to damage his government’s image after he cut their funding. Bolsonaro, who has shocked environmentalists with plans to open the Amazon to business interests, said NGOs could be behind the record number of wildfires this year, although he presented no evidence to backup his claim. Bolsonaro said everything indicates that NGOs are going to the Amazon to set fire to the forest. When asked if he had evidence to back up his claims, he said he had no written plan, adding that’s not how it’s done. Bolsonaro said the slashing of NGO funding by his government could be a motive for them burning down the forest as they seek to bring his government into disrepute. Crime exists, he said during a Facebook Live broadcast. These people are missing the money. Bolsonaro’s latest comments enraged environmentalists, who are increasingly concerned by his administration’s attitudes towards the world’s largest rainforest, a vital bulwark against climate change. Brazil is home to more than half of the Amazon. This is a sick statement, a pitiful statement, said Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace Brazil’s public policy coordinator. Increased deforestation and burning are the result of his anti-environmental policy. Bolsonaro, a longtime sceptic of environmental concerns, wants to open the Amazon to more agriculture and mining, and has told other countries worried about rising deforestation since he took office to mind their own business. Congressman Nilto Tatto, leader of the lower house environment caucus, said Bolsonaro’s stunning attack on the NGOs was a smoke screen to hide his dismantling of Brazil’s environmental protections built up over 30 years. Bolsonaro on Wednesday said the administration is working to control fires currently raging in the Amazon rainforest, which have reached a record number this year. Brazil’s space research center, INPE, has detected 72,843 fires so far in 2019. When asked about the spread of uncontrolled fires, Bolsonaro has brushed off criticism, saying it is the time of the year of the queimada or burn, when farmers use fire to clear land. REUTERS.

‘We won’t give an inch’: India faces defiance in ‘Kashmir’s Gaza’,"Young men sit beside a pile of rocks and a bonfire, protecting the only entrance to a besieged neighbourhood they call Kashmir’s Gaza as a mosque loudspeaker broadcasts slogans of liberation. In an act of defiance against New Delhi’s controversial decision to withdraw occupied Kashmir’s special status and integrate it fully into India, Soura neighbourhood on the outskirts of Srinagar has sealed itself off from security forces. Since early August, residents have erected ramshackle barricades of tin sheets, wooden logs, oil tanks and concrete pillars, and dug trenches to keep soldiers at bay amid daily protests against India. They can only enter Soura over our bodies. We won’t give even an inch of land to India, Mufeed, a resident who volunteers to guard the neighbourhood at night, told AFP. Just like Gaza is resisting Israel, we will fight for our motherland with all our might, Mufeed added. Ahead of the announcement, India rushed tens of thousands of extra troops to the restive region to join 500,000 already in there and imposed a strict clampdown fearing further unrest. But protests have broken out, with the lower-middle class Soura leading the way. At least 15,000 people rallied on August 9 — the biggest demonstration in occupied Kashmir so far. They were met by security forces firing live ammunition, tear gas and pellet guns to disperse the crowds, with more than two dozen people reportedly injured. ‘Go India, go back’ Soura, a crammed lakeside community of more than 2,000 homes, is surrounded by security forces on three sides. The renowned mosque Jenab Saeb has become an assembly point for thousands of protesters in the neighbourhood. Every night, residents march through its narrow lanes, carrying torches and passing graffiti with the words Freedom for Kashmir and Go India, go back. Locals pass along messages if they spot any police movement on the main highway just beyond Soura. Police forces, who have deployed drones and helicopters, tried to enter Soura at least three times but were pushed back by stone-throwing youth, some also armed with axes and harpoons. Familiar with police’s crowd-dispersing tactics, protesters use salt water to wash their faces after chilli and tear gas are fired, and wear helmets and glasses to protect themselves against pellets. Three youths have so far been arrested after venturing out from the area. They (India) are testing our resilience and they will definitely fail, local Nahida told AFP. We defeated them last time and even if this situation continues for years, we won’t give-in. Despite the Soura protests, authorities stress that occupied Kashmir has remained largely peaceful since the lockdown. ‘Making amends’ Soura has long been part of the restive region’s history. It was the birthplace of Kashmir’s former prime minister Sheikh Abdullah, who agreed to join India as a state with autonomy rights in 1947. His National Conference party — which has fought for more autonomy — was in power for more than three decades, with his son Farooq Abdullah and grandson Omar Abdullah becoming chief ministers of occupied Kashmir. Farooq and Omar Abdullah were detained by New Delhi as part of the lockdown. Residents have become more anti-India in recent years. In 2016 when mass street protests broke out over the death of a popular Kashmiri fighter, Soura was the scene of dozens of clashes with government forces. Soura resident Rafiq Mansoor Shah said many locals shared his misgivings about Sheikh Abdullah’s decision to accede to India. Under the new arrangements announced this month, Indians can now apply for government jobs and buy property in occupied Kashmir. But many Soura natives like Shah believe New Delhi has nefarious plans to grab our land. Because of (the Abdullah family’s) greed for power […] we have become slaves of India. We are trying to correct the historical mistake, he told AFP. We are trying to lead and inspire the rest of Kashmir. AFP.

Emmanuel Macron to discuss Indian occupied Kashmir with Narendra Modi,"PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron will discuss tensions in occupied Kashmir with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when the two meet in Paris this week, a French official said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also weighed in on Indian occupied Kashmir Tuesday telling Modi in a phone call that the issue was one for India and Pakistan to resolve between themselves through dialogue. Macron and Modi are set to sit down for a working dinner at the Chateau de Chantilly outside Paris on Thursday ahead of a G7 summit in France this weekend, to which Modi has been invited. Of course it (Kashmir) will be on the agenda, a French diplomat said on condition of anonymity. We have a strategic partnership with India, that means having confidence in each other. We are not going to be aggressive towards India, but we expect the Indian prime minister to explain how he sees things. On August 5, Modi’s Hindu nationalist government scrapped the autonomy of Indian occupied Kashmir, a divided Muslim-majority region that has enjoyed special status in the Indian constitution since the country´s independence from Britain in 1947. The move has enraged many Kashmiris and led to tensions with nuclear-armed neighbour Pakistan.  India resents any outside interference in Kashmir and its Western allies have historically avoided taking public positions on the dispute, despite allegations of human rights abuses there. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Johnson and Modi discussed the current situation in Kashmir and the British leader made clear that the UK views the issue of Kashmir is one for India and Pakistan to resolve bilaterally. Johnson underlined the importance of resolving issues through dialogue, she added. They looked forward to meeting at the (G7) summit. The French diplomat recalled France’s similar position that Pakistan and India should resolve their differences between themselves and that both sides should avoid raising tensions. Modi has been invited to this weekend´s Group of Seven meeting of major economic powers in Biarritz and is seen by France as a crucial ally in the fight against climate change. Macron is hoping the newly re-elected Indian leader will announce new pledges to curb Indian carbon emissions and will also sign up to a coalition of countries to tackle pollution from so-called HFC gases used in refrigerators and air-conditioning.

I have resigned from the cricket committee and have applied for the post of Pakistan´s head coach, said the former batsman, describing the position as a dream.

"Ashes Test: Australia astonish England as Cummings, Smith strike","Australia’s Steve Smith returned to make 92 after a sickening blow to the neck before England captain Joe Root fell for the first golden duck of his Test career as Pat Cummins took two wickets in two balls on a dramatic fourth day of the second Ashes clash at Lord’s. England were 96-4 in their second innings — a lead of 104 runs — when rain forced an early close on Saturday. But with one day left, Australia know early wickets on Sunday could leave them in a position to press for a victory that would put them 2-0 up in a five-match series. England will now look to Ben Stokes, dropped twice on his way to 16 not out, and Jos Buttler (10 not out), to keep Australia at bay. Smith’s 92 was the centrepiece of Australia’s 250 all out in reply to England’s first innings 258. The star batsman had made 80 when he was felled by a bouncer from fast bowler Jofra Archer, making his Test debut, timed at 92.4 mph. The ball struck him on the side of the neck and head. Smith, fell face forward onto the ground. He was wearing a helmet without the additional neck protection that was introduced following the death of Phillip Hughes after his former Australia team-mate was hit by a bouncer in a 2014 domestic Sheffield Shield match in Sydney. He doesn’t wear it because it is a personal choice, Australia coach Justin Langer told Sky Sports after stumps. We know it is available but he can’t feel comfortable with it on. ‘Terrible blow’ Smith, who had marked his comeback Test following a 12-month ball-tampering ban, with innings of 144 and 142 in Australia’s 251-run win in the series opener at Edgbaston, received several minutes of on-field treatment involving both teams’ medical staff. He got to his feet but eventually retired hurt, with Smith receiving a generous round of applause as he returned to the pavilion. It was a terrible blow, said Langer. It looked horrible at the time. This series has seen the introduction of concussion protocols that allow injured batsmen to be replaced by a substitute — previously restricted to fielding duty alone. But Langer insisted Smith’s health had not been put at undue risk by letting him resume his innings as soon as possible when Peter Siddle’s exit left Australia 218-7 after a break of 46 minutes. We were, absolutely (happy for Smith to bat again). He went through the concussion testing, said Langer, himself hit on the head several times during his career as an Australia opening batsman. We wouldn’t let him go out unless we were confident he could do the job. Archer had previously struck Smith, then on 70, on his unprotected forearm with another bouncer in a fiery eight-over spell. ‘Serious pace’ And it was that injury, not the blow to the neck, which Australia said prevented Smith from fielding on Saturday, although a team spokesman said later that hospital X-rays had revealed no fracture. From the second and third balls he faced on his return, Smith hit two fours off paceman Chris Woakes. But on 92, facing his ninth ball, Smith shouldered arms to a Woakes nip-back delivery and was plumb lbw to leave Australia 234-8. Smith reviewed almost as an after-thought before replays confirmed the end of a 161-ball innings that included 14 fours. Stuart Broad took 4-65 in 27.3 overs and Woakes 3-61 in 19 while Archer finished with figures of 2-59 in 29. That was serious, serious pace, said Woakes of Archer. I was at fine leg and could still tell. It is never nice to see anyone get hit. Thankfully it looks like Steve is OK. He is a great player and it took something special from Jofra to get him out of his bubble. England then suffered an a familiar collapse, Jason Roy, caught and bowled by Cummins (2-16) off a leading edge. Next ball, 9-1 became 9-2 with Root caught behind off a superb delivery. Joe Denly survived the hat-trick before being caught and bowled by Siddle (2-19), who also removed Rory Burns. AFP.

Fate of Pak-India Davis Cup tie to be decided after Monday,"MUMBAI: The All India Tennis Association will discuss its concerns over next month’s Davis Cup tie between India and Pakistan with security advisers from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) on Monday, AITA General Secretary Hironmoy Chatterjee has said. Security representatives of the governing bodies will speak in a telephone call that will also be attended by India’s Davis Cup captain Mahesh Bhupathi, after which AITA will decide whether the Indian team travels to Islamabad, Chatterjee added. The Indian side wants safety guarantees before travelling for the September 14-15 tie, with tensions high between the neighbours after New Delhi revoked the special status of the disputed region of Kashmir. AITA wrote to the ITF on Wednesday to ask if the tie could be moved to a neutral venue or postponed after Pakistan last week expelled India’s ambassador and suspended bilateral trade and public transport links with its neighbour. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since 1947 and came close to a third in February. Chatterjee told Reuters on Thursday that the ITF had shared security arrangements for the Indian team in Islamabad but had not said anything about India’s request to shift the tie out of Pakistan or postpone it. We have been given time on August 19 for a telephonic conversation between the security advisors of the ITF and AITA, he added. We will make a decision after Monday’s call. We will try and explain to them the prevailing sentiment and tension among the people of the two countries. The security will be entirely provided by the Pakistan government which has already downgraded diplomatic relations with India. The ITF needs to understand that there could be a possibility of the security cover being withdrawn by the government due to public sentiment. In that scenario, we will be just sitting ducks there. How can we take such risks?

India want to take away Davis Cup tie from Pakistan,"India have asked the International Tennis Federation to shift their upcoming Davis Cup tie from Pakistan to a neutral venue due to escalating political tensions between the two nations. The Indian team are scheduled to tour Pakistan’s capital Islamabad for the Asia/Oceania Group 1 tie to be held on September 14 and 15. But relations between the neighbours are badly strained after India revoked the special autonomy status of occupied Kashmir, which the nuclear-armed rivals have fought two wars over since gaining independence from Britain in 1947. We have asked ITF for a neutral venue because the situation is a bit unpredictable, All India Tennis Association (AITA) president Praveen Mahajan told AFP on Sunday. I believe it is a reasonable request because of the current state of affairs. Pakistan has downgraded diplomatic ties with India amid a military lockdown in Indian-occupied Kashmir and stopped a cross-border train. The AITA was preparing to send its team to Pakistan despite suspended sporting ties between the two countries but the occupied Kashmir situation has raised fresh doubts. An Indian tennis team last toured Pakistan in 1964 for the Davis Cup, where they defeated the hosts 4-0. Until a few years ago, Pakistan were forced to host home Davis Cup ties at neutral venues as teams refused to travel to the South Asian nation over security concerns. I am hopeful they will shift the tie because Pakistan is used to playing in neutral venues, Mahajan said. ITF will respond to our request shortly, sometime this week. Pakistan Tennis Federation president Salim Saifullah Khan had earlier said they would honour the decision of the ITF if the AITA sought a neutral venue. India named a full-strength squad for the crucial tie with the country’s highest-ranked players in Prajnesh Gunneswaran (90) and Ramkumar Ramanathan (184) to play the four singles matches.

EU leaders early this month picked Lagarde to succeed ECB chief Mario Draghi, whose single, eight-year term ends in November. Lagarde stepped away from the IMF leadership post she has held since 2011, sparking a wave of speculation about who would replace her. The IMF board tapped her number two, American David Lipton, to serve as interim managing director, but by tradition a European always leads the fund while an American runs its sister institution, the World Bank.

After rejecting all cut motions of the opposition parties a day earlier, the lower house passed the finance bill today. Opposition recorded strong protest over the budget prior to the voting, with most members of the opposition wearing black armbands.

This is an anti-growth budget that will bring in unemployment, poverty, and backwardness. Iqbal deemed the budget an anti-poor, anti-salaried class budget and that the selected budget should be withdrawn and a new people-friendly budget should be presented. Hammad Azhar responded to the opposition by saying that the opposition was quoting wrong figures and that he was sure that the opposition had not actually read the budget document. Azhar, amid strong chanting by the opposition, went on to say, that For the first time in the country’s history, we have reduced civil expenditures up to five per cent. Azhar tried to quote figures from the budget document in an attempt to prove that Prime Minister House’s expenditures had actually been cut and that no new taxes had been imposed on ghee. Azhar said that the government intends to raise the tax by four percent as it has become imperative to ensure stable national growth. The national economy was intentionally paralyzed by previous governments for their vested interests while the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government has cut down the current account deficit by 30 per cent, said Azhar. He added, there exists a need to increase taxes, in the previous 10 years only 2 percent tax increase was seen. The federal government would be bankrupt if the tax isn’t increased by 4 percent.

Nobel Prize winning author Toni Morrison passes away,"Toni Morrison, the first African-American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature and one of America’s best loved writers, has died following a brief illness, her family said Tuesday. She was 88. Barack Obama — who awarded Morrison the Presidential Medal of Freedom — led the tributes, describing her as a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while, the former US president wrote on Twitter. Morrison wrote 11 novels, many of them touching on life as a black American, in a glittering literary and award-laden career that lasted over six decades. She also penned numerous essays, poems and speeches and was often referred to as America’s conscience for her poignant takes on race and human rights, never afraid of commenting on the day’s weightiest political issues. Her family said she passed away peacefully at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York on Monday night surrounded by family and friends. Although her passing represents a tremendous loss, we are grateful she had a long, well lived life, they said in a statement, describing her as the consummate writer who treasured the written word. Pulitzer Prize Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award in 1988 for her 1987 novel Beloved. Set after the American Civil War in the 1860s, the story centered on a slave who escaped Kentucky to the free state of Ohio. The book was later turned into a film starring Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey. Morrison received numerous other accolades including the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993. In 1996, she was honored with the National Book Foundation’s Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. In 2012, Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and in 2016 she received the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction. She was a great woman and a great writer, and I don’t know which I will miss more, Robert Gottlieb, Morrison’s longtime editor at Knopf publishers, said in a statement sent to AFP. Sonny Mehta, chairman of Knopf, said he could think of few writers in American letters who wrote with more humanity or with more love for language than Toni. Her narratives and mesmerizing prose have made an indelible mark on our culture. Her novels command and demand our attention. They are canonical works, and more importantly, they are books that remain beloved by readers, he said. Morrison was born as Chloe Anthony Wofford on February 18, 1931 in Ohio. The Bluest Eye, her first novel, was published in 1970 when she was almost 40 years old. She followed up with Sula in 1973, going on to publish another nine novels, including the acclaimed Song of Solomon in 1977, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. ‘Empress-Supreme’ Her writings touched many, including Obama who recalled reading Song of Solomon as a child and not just trying to figure out how to write, but also how to be and how to think. Kamala Harris, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said America had lost one of its greatest voices and storytellers. Her work gave us power, hope & freedom. While our world shines a little less bright today, we know ‘something that is loved is never lost,' she tweeted, referencing a quote of Morrison’s. Winfrey called her the Empress-Supreme among writers. She was a magician with language who understood the power of words. She used them to roil us, to wake us, to educate us and help us grapple with our deepest wounds and try to comprehend them, she wrote on Instagram. Morrison also worked as an editor at Random House, the first African-American woman to do so, and taught creative writing for many years, including at Princeton University. Her life was touched by tragedy. In 2010, her son Slade died of pancreatic cancer aged just 45. AFP.

‘Game of Thrones’ prequel unaffected by S8 backlash: HBO,"BEVERLY HILLS: The first episode of a possible prequel series to HBO’s global hit Game of Thrones has completed filming in Belfast, a network executive said on Wednesday. HBO executives will review the episode before deciding whether to make a full season but Casey Bloys, president of programming at the network owned by AT&T Inc, appeared upbeat about what he had seen so far. It looks really good. The cast was amazing, Bloys said in response to questions at a Television Critics Association event where networks preview upcoming shows. With Game of Thrones concluding its eight-season run in May, many fans are eager to return to the fictional world of Westeros created by author George R.R. Martin. The series was a cornerstone of HBO’s primetime offerings, but its final season was divisive, with both fans and critics finding specific plot twists, particularly the handling of one primary character, troubling. Nearly 1.7 million people signed an online petition calling for a rewrite of the final season. Despite the uproar, Game of Thrones led this year’s Emmy contenders with 32 nominations. Bloys said the backlash did not change the network’s approach to the prequel, which stars Naomi Watts and is set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. The petition showed a lot of enthusiasm and passion for the show, Bloys said, but wasn’t something we seriously considered. There are very, very few downsides to having a hugely popular show, Bloys said. One I can think of is when you try to end it, many people have opinions on how it should end … I think it just comes with the territory. REUTERS.

"Mohsin Abbas granted anticipatory bail, police barred from arresting him","LAHORE: Actor, singer, Mohsin Abbas Haider appeared in a sessions court in Lahore on Wednesday where he was granted anticipatory bail on payment of Rs50,000 bonds. The court has also asked Defence C Police Station to submit a detailed report of the case and set the date of August 5 for the next hearing. Police late Tuesday registered a first information report (FIR) against Haider on behalf of Fatema Sohail, his wife who has accused him of cheating and domestic violence. The charges of threats to kill as well as a breach of trust was included in the FIR, but police at the Defence station excluded Mohsin Abbas Haider’s extra-marital affair with another woman. The petition, filed by Sohail, alleges that Haider had an extra-marital affair with a woman, whom he drunkenly brought home with him and whom he took to his bedroom before locking the door behind him. Karachi’s Defence police station has the proof of the claims, added Sohail. Ignoring the allegations put forward by the petition, the police said all angles would be considered in the investigation. Earlier, the statements of both Haider and Sohail were recorded by Raza Safdar Kazmi, the superintendent of police (SP) for the Cantt area. The former had accused the latter of beating, abusing, and assaulting her, and demanding she give him Rs5 million, which she did by borrowing the amount from her father. Sohail further alleged that although Haider’s behaviour changed for a few days after acquiring the Rs5 million, he went out of control again soon afterward and demanded she gives him another Rs5 million. When she refused to do so, he beat her up and verbally abused her. Sohail also alleged that Haider threatened with a pistol when she told her brother, Muhammad Ali, about the matter. Prior to this, Fatema said she did not feel terrified of Mohsin for the first time today. Fatema Sohail, who, too, has worked in the media, spoke to journalists at her residence after meeting Punjab Women Protection Authority (PWPA) Chairperson Kaneez Fatima Chahdar, who had come to discuss the matter of alleged torture. At the police station, I was not terrified of Mohsin for the first time today, Fatema said, adding, Earlier, I used to be petrified all the time about when the abuse would start. Chahdar assured her that her organisation would provide her all possible assistance in the case, adding, no matter how powerful the abuser is, we will make sure they meet their fate.

Fatema Sohail urges abused women to step forward and speak up,"Actor Mohsin Abbas Haider’s wife, Fatema Sohail has responded to what Mohsin had to say during his press conference yesterday, in which he denied the domestic abuse allegations levelled against him. Placing her hand on the Holy Quran, Fatema said, my pictures are real; Mohsin had hit me when I was 3 months pregnant. I had never thought I’d get a police case registered, I waited until the birth of my son. He would not only abuse me physically but also mentally by talking to his girlfriend, by swearing at me. I left to go to my mother’s house to save my life and he’s deeming that as a separation. I got slapped on the third or fourth day of our marriage and Dua Malik is a witness to that. I was enduring it all quietly, I was keeping the people from within the industry who knew like Gohar Rasheed and Hamza Ali Abbasi silent because it was a love marriage, I wanted to save my home. He says I fell down the stairs. Why did I not go to a doctor if I fell down the stairs during pregnancy? I was slapped so hard, I couldn’t even open my mouth to speak, she said. Fatema began her press conference saying that Mohsin, who had mentioned in his presser that he had just come from giving his statement at the police station, did not do so. She said she spoke to the SHO who told her that Mohsin had recorded no statement at the station. He is now twisting his words around, saying I was sitting in the car and my lawyers went inside. When he came to the station today, for the first time in my life, I wasn’t scared of this man. Otherwise, I would be sitting in fear, that he’d start beating me, she added. She then shared her medical report from the November 2018 incident on her Instagram stories:  Now that Mohsin sees he’s got no way out, no evidence, he is trying to patch up with me but that is not going to happen. I can not have my baby around such a dangerous man nor do I want to live with him anymore. I’ve received numerous calls and messages from other women saying they are in my shoes but don’t know how to take a stand against their abusive husbands. Women are forced to leave work so they’re scared because of the financial dependence on men, said Fatema, noting that the case has gotten bigger in its scope than her plight. I sort of went into shock because I [spoke up and] was going to fight for my child’s rights but this is so prevalent … this is something else. I’m now fighting for my women as well. Take a stand, come out, and speak up! God is the one who takes care of us all. These women are often financially weak, they think ‘who will take care of me, who will take care of my children?’, she noted. Fatema Sohail further emphasised that these women are afraid of being utterly financially dependent on their husbands and it’s worrisome. Please come out and speak up. Women have said to me they want to soak up but I’m not sure if they would actually be able to or not. They just have the same fear — being financially weak. She urged women suffering from abuse to step forward. Later, Fatema, outside the police station, said she will be determined to her application and will tell the police whatever they asked her. Although she mentioned, the FIR [first information report] is still not being registered. I don’t know what the reason behind this is or if there is any kind of pressure from somewhere but the FIR was not registered. I have told you over and over again that the pictures I shared on social media were from 2018 and in the four years of my marriage, I was abused often, Fatema said when asked about not having a medical test done to file the FIR on basis of the report. I never had the intention to come out in the public about this. I couldn’t open my mouth because he slapped me so hard, she said. At the meeting, the chairperson of Punjab Women Protection Authority, Fatima Chaddar said that Sohail would get all the legal protection that she needed, adding that her case has reached the chief minister and she would receive justice.

Cast explains what happened next to Game of Thrones characters,"Cast members of Game of Thrones appeared at San Diego Comic-Con on Friday to discuss the HBO fantasy epic’s controversial final season. As well as defending the series conclusion, the actors were asked what they think happened next to their characters. Here is what they told a packed theatre at the pop culture fan convention: Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark) –
I can’t imagine his government is a barrel of laughs. It’s probably quite serious. To all intents and purposes, Westeros is now a surveillance state, with Bran aware of everything everyone is doing. Maisie Williams (Arya Stark)
I’m sure she’s having a wonderful time like Dora the Explorer, minus the bob. But maybe she cut a bob in, you know? West of Westeros might like the bob. I don’t think being with a partner is what would make her feel the most at home or the most fulfilled.

Tom Cruise ascends to the skies yet again in Top Gun 2 trailer,"Top Gun roared back on Thursday when Tom Cruise made a surprise appearance at Comic-Con to show the first trailer for the long-awaited sequel to his military action movie. Top Gun: Maverick, due for release in June 2020, sees the return of Cruise’s cocky fighter pilot more than 30 years after the original movie launched his career as a global action star.  I was always asked ‘When are you going to do another one?’ Well, you’ve been very patient with me. I felt like it was my responsibility to really deliver for you, Cruise told fans gathered for the annual Comic-Con movie, television and comic book event in San Diego, according to entertainment website Deadline. The trailer shows Cruise wearing Pete Maverick Mitchell’s famous leather jacket, racing on a motorcycle and flying a fighter jet through a narrow snow-filled canyon. The sequel picks up decades after the 1986 box-office hit and features actor Miles Teller as the son of Anthony Edwards’ pilot Goose, who is killed during a training exercise in the first movie.

Successful 5G trials conducted in Pakistan,"China Mobile Pakistan (CMPak, popularly known as Zong) on Thursday successfully conducted 5G trials in Pakistan, a press release issued by the company said. After conducting the trails, Zong has become the first and only operator to officially test 5G services in the country, the statement added. This success marks an important milestone in Pakistan’s telecom sector, said Zong CEO Wang Hua at an event in Islamabad held to conduct the test. 5G will herald a new era in Pakistan’s social and economic sectors, said Hua. Zong believes that 5G will bring more profound and long-term changes to Pakistan’s economic transformation, social progress, and people’s livelihood improvement in future. It is expected that 5G will have an impact on health care, agriculture and education, said the press release. At the event, the Zong CEO also announced that the company will establish a 5G research centre in collaboration with the government of Pakistan. He reiterated that five years ago, it was CMPak that had first brought 4G technology to Pakistan. Hua said that the introduction of 5G services is an important pillar to meet future technological needs. PTA chairman retired Maj Gen Amir Azeem Bajwa also spoke on the occasion. The country will soon be able to enjoy 5G services which will be introduced for commercial purposes, he said.

"Google, Facebook, Amazon condemn French digital tax as ‘discriminatory’","WASHINGTON: American tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google joined forces on Monday to decry the French digital tax as retroactive and discriminatory. President Donald Trump is considering retaliating against the tax — approved July 11 — with punitive tariffs on French wine imports, prompting an investigation by the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR). The so-called GAFA companies appeared at a USTR hearing on possible countermeasures and were unanimous in their complaints, calling the tax a troubling precedent. The tax, which Washington considers unfair, adds yet another bone of contention to the transatlantic trade disputes that now also include steel, aluminium, automobiles, aircraft and agriculture. The proposed three per cent tax on total annual revenues of companies that provide services to French consumers applies only to the largest tech companies, which are mostly US-based. For Amazon, where France represents the second largest European market for e-commerce, the levy creates double taxation, said Peter Hiltz, director of tax planning for the online retail giant. Some 58 per cent of Amazon’s sales are through partner companies, which stand to take the hit. The tax negatively impacts Amazon and thousands of small and medium businesses, Hiltz said. Amazon cannot absorb the expenses, and the company already informed partners that their fee will increase starting October 1, he added Some internet heavyweights have taken advantage of low-tax jurisdictions in places like Ireland while paying next to nothing in other countries where they derive huge profits. The United States has been pushing for an overarching agreement on the taxation of digital commerce through the Group of 20 economic forum, but France pressed ahead on its own. It is an imperfect solution to address an outdated tax system, said Jennifer McCloskey of the Information Technology Industry Council, which supports a multilateral agreement under the auspices of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. Hiltz agreed, saying the companies believe an international agreement under the OECD is reachable. The tax will apply to about 30 companies with at least $28 million (25 million euros) in sales in France and $831 million worldwide. But it does not apply to other internet operators like media companies. The tax touches a handful of internet business when every sector is becoming digital, Google’s Nicholas Bramble said at the hearing. Taxing only this part of the industry doesn’t make sense. The companies also complained that the tax is retroactive since it will apply from the beginning of 2019 — something they have never seen before, according to Alan Lee of Facebook. AFP.

Huawei launches own operating system to rival Android,"Chinese telecom giant Huawei unveiled its own operating system on Friday, as it faces the threat of losing access to Android systems amid escalating US-China trade tensions. Richard Yu, the head of Huawei’s consumer business, told a press conference in the southern city of Dongguan that the new system, called HarmonyOS or HongMeng in Chinese, would bring more harmony and convenience to the world. The highly-anticipated software is considered crucial for the tech group’s survival as it confronts a looming White House ban on US companies selling technology products to Huawei which could remove its access to Google’s Android operating system. Yu said the new system was a future oriented OS to be more smooth and secure, which he said was completely different from Android and iOS. Huawei said the first version of the operating system would launch later this year in its smart screen products, before expanding across a range of smart devices including wearable technology over the next three years. If you’re asking when will we apply this to the smartphone, we can do it at any time, said Yu, adding that they gave priority to using Google’s Android operating system, which is compatible with Harmony. However, if we cannot use it (Android) in the future, we can immediately switch to the Harmony OS, he said. In May the company was swept into the deepening trade war between Beijing and Washington which has seen punitive tariffs slapped on billions of dollars of two-way trade. Huawei — considered the world leader in superfast fifth-generation or 5G equipment and the world’s number two smartphone producer— has been blacklisted by US President Donald Trump amid suspicions it provides a backdoor for Chinese intelligence services, something the firm denies. On Thursday Beijing slammed US rules banning Huawei and other Chinese companies from government contracts, saying they amounted to an abuse of state power. As a result of US moves to blacklist Huawei, American companies are theoretically no longer allowed to sell technology products to the firm, but a three-month exemption period— which ends next week— was granted by Washington before the measure came into force. That ban could prevent the Chinese tech firm from getting hold of key hardware and software including smartphone chips and elements of the Google Android operating system, which equips the vast majority of smartphones in the world, including those of Huawei. Huawei has reportedly been working on its own operating system since 2012, but the group has always said publicly it didn’t want to replace its Android phones with a home operating system. Yu told German newspaper Die Welt in an interview published in March that creating their own operating system was Plan B. Huawei will be able to develop at a lower cost a brand new ecosystem and mitigate its dependence on US suppliers for its software needs, Kenny Liew, technology analyst at Fitch Solutions, told AFP. However, smartphones using the system would mainly be confined to the Chinese market, Liew said. Developing an operating system and the entire ecosystem that accompanies it is a complex affair. Apart from Google’s Android, the only other popular operating system is Apple’s iOS, available exclusively on the iPhone. Microsoft pulled the plug on its Windows Phone platform earlier this year, and Samsung’s Tizen system is barely known compared with Android and iOS. But without access to the full version of Android or the popular services of Google— not to mention the many applications available on the Google Play store— Huawei may have trouble convincing consumers outside China to buy its phones.

Earth’s strongest creatures may be residing on Moon,"WASHINGTON: There might be life on the Moon after all: thousands of virtually indestructible creatures that can withstand extreme radiation, sizzling heat, the coldest temperatures of the universe, and decades without food. These terrifying-sounding beings aren’t aliens but instead microscopic Earthlings known as tardigrades, who likely made it out alive following a crash landing on the lunar surface by Israel’s Beresheet probe in April, the US-based organisation responsible for their trip said on Tuesday.  Based on an analysis of the spacecraft’s trajectory and the composition of the device the micro-animals were stored in, we believe the chances of survival for the tardigrades… are extremely high, said Nova Spivack, co-founder and chairman of the Arch Mission Foundation. Tardigrades are ideal to include because they are microscopic, multicellular, and one of the most durable forms of life on planet Earth, he said. He added that the diminutive creatures, which are under a millimetre (0.04 inches) in size, had been dehydrated to place them in suspended animation, then encased in an epoxy of Artificial Amber, and should be revivable in the future. The tardigrades were stored inside a Lunar Library, a nanotechnology device that resembles a DVD and contains a 30-million-page archive of human history viewable under microscopes, as well as human DNA. Also known as water bears or moss piglets, tardigrades can live in water or on land, and are capable of surviving temperatures as high as 150 degrees Celsius and as low as minus 272 degrees Celsius, albeit for a few minutes. The grub-like, eight-legged animals can come back from being dried out to a lifeless husk for decades, withstand near-zero pressure in outer space and the crushing depths of the Mariana Trench. If they did not burn up in an explosion, they could in theory survive the tiny pressure on the lunar surface, and the extremes of temperature, William Miller, a tardigrades expert at Baker University, said. But to become active, to grow, eat, and reproduce they would need water, air and food, so it would not be possible for them to multiply and form a colony, he added. Nasa astrobiologist Cassie Conley said that their exact survival time would depend on the condition of the impact site and the temperatures to which they are exposed. If they don’t get too hot, it’s possible they could survive for quite a long time [many years], she said. Even if the creatures lived on for several years, there is no crewed mission to the Moon planned until Nasa’s Artemis programme in 2024 at the south pole — far from Beresheet’s crash site on the Sea of Serenity, so they probably won’t make it home. It is unlikely that they will be rescued in time, so my guess is that, even if they survived, they are doomed, said Rafael Alves Batista, a physicist at Sao Paulo university who co-authored a 2017 paper on tardigrades’ extreme resilience.

Two US senators raise privacy concerns over Facebook’s Messenger Kids,"Democratic US senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal have written to Facebook Inc questioning whether there was a worrying pattern of poor privacy protection for children using its Messenger Kids app. The senators were disturbed to learn that the application allowed thousands of children to join group chats in which not all members of the group were approved by their parents, they said in a letter addressed to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. The app, launched in December 2017, is designed for users under the age of 13. It lets them do video chats and send photos, videos and texts. Facebook has a responsibility to meet its promise to parents that children are not exposed to unapproved contacts, a promise that it appears that Facebook has not fulfilled, they said. Children’s privacy and safety online should be Messenger Kids’ top priority. The senators sought transparency and answers on what the company is doing to ensure children’s privacy and safety online, and meet expectations of parents and fulfill law obligations. The senators also asked Zuckerberg when did the company first become aware of the flaw and the duration it existed. They also asked if Facebook has initiated a review of the app to identify other flaws that may exist. They also demanded that Facebook reply to these questions by Aug. 27. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. REUTERS.

UAE’s du says US ban on Huawei not an issue for 5G network,"DUBAI: United Arab Emirates telecoms company du has discussed US restrictions on Huawei with the Chinese company and believes they will not hamper its 5G network, its chief executive said on Wednesday. American companies were banned in May from selling most US parts and components to Huawei without special licences, raising concerns about the company’s supply chain. Du uses Huawei equipment in its 5G network, but the UAE company’s chief executive, Osman Sultan, said it had discussed the matter with Huawei and it did not see any issue. We do not have a concern for the network deployment, for the use of Huawei equipment within the network, Sultan told reporters on an earnings conference call. Du, which is also using Nokia’s 5G technology, expects to have close to 800 active 5G mobile infrastructure sites by the end of the year. The UAE is one of several Gulf Arab states, who are close partners of the United States, using Huawei 5G technology. Washington says that the Chinese company’s technology could be exploited by Beijing for spying and has threatened to cut off intelligence-sharing with nations that use Huawei equipment. China and Huawei reject the claims. There are regular tests done, not only by us but as well by the authorities … and we never had any instruction or directive to stop the use of any of the Huawei equipment, Sultan said. The other telecoms company in the UAE, state-controlled Etisalat, is using Huawei and Ericsson 5G technology. It has not commented on the US-Huawei issue. US officials have privately raised their concerns with Emirati counterparts, according to two sources familiar with the matter and a former American official, all of whom declined to be further identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The UAE, which shares intelligence with the United States and hosts US soldiers, believes it can manage the risk, one of the sources said.

Viral app ‘FaceApp’ causing fears of invasion of privacy,"A Viral app named ‘FaceApp’ has been giving people the ability to change their facial expressions, looks, and now age for several years.

The app has been downloaded by more than 100 million people from Google Play. According to App Annie, FaceApp is now the top-ranked app on the iOS App Store in 121 countries.

Instagram hides ‘likes’ from more users,"SYDNEY: Instagram started hiding likes on its platform in Australia, Brazil and several other major markets Thursday, saying it wanted to ease pressure on users, following criticism about its impacts on mental health. The Facebook-owned social media giant’s trial changes mean users in the six countries will no longer be able to see the number of likes other people’s posts receive. We want Instagram to be a place where people feel comfortable expressing themselves, Facebook Australia and New Zealand policy director Mia Garlick said in a statement. We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive, so you can focus on sharing the things you love. Australia, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Brazil and New Zealand are involved in the new trial, which follows an initial test that was launched in Canada in May. Although Instagram described the hiding of the likes for users as a test, no deadline was given for when it would end. Instagram, which has more than one billion users worldwide, is a platform that allows users to post images and videos that others can then like or comment on. But, in the chosen test countries, likes will not be visible on people´s profiles, the main image feed or permalink pages. And while Instagram users will still be able to view the total number of likes on their own posts, they will need to click through to another page in order to do so. Social media scrutiny Social media giants have faced increased scrutiny over the impact their platforms can have on users, and there is some research to suggest Instagram can negatively affect the mental health of young people who use it. A 2017 study by the Royal Society for Public Health ranked Instagram as the worst social media platform for young people’s mental health in the United Kingdom. A 2018 survey of teenagers in the United States by the Pew Research Center found that nearly 40 per cent felt pressure to only share digital content that had garnered a lot of likes or comments. Another statement from Instagram as it announced the trial changes for the likes also emphasised they were in response to concerns about the pressures that users felt. We are testing this because we want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get, an Instagram spokesman said. We don’t want Instagram to feel like a competition. The latest measure came just a week after Instagram implemented new features aimed at curbing online bullying using artificial intelligence. In another effort introduced in February to safeguard the mental health of young users, Instagram clamped down on images related to self-harm. Instagram said the measures to conceal likes would not affect measurement tools used by businesses that use the platform to promote their products. AFP.

Senate to grill Facebook over plans for Libra cryptocurrency,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK: US lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are set to grill Facebook Inc on its cryptocurrency plans on Tuesday, as the project continues to draw intense scrutiny from financial regulators and politicians across the globe. Facebook is fighting a rearguard action to get Washington onside after it shocked regulators and lawmakers with an announcement on June 18 that it was hoping to launch a new digital coin called Libra in 2020. Since then it has faced a barrage of criticism from policymakers and financial watchdogs at home and abroad who fear widespread adoption of the digital currency by the social media giant’s 2.38 billion users could upend the financial system. Critics have expressed anger that the company would have got so far in its plans for such a potentially groundbreaking project without extensive input from policymakers, especially when it is already in the spotlight over privacy issues. The Senate Banking Committee will question David Marcus, the company’s top executive overseeing the project, on issues ranging from how Libra could affect global monetary policy to how customer data will be handled. Marcus, who was president of PayPal from 2012 to 2014, will try to assuage concerns by promising that Facebook will not begin offering Libra until regulatory issues are addressed, according to prepared testimony the committee posted on Monday. We know we need to take the time to get this right, Marcus, who is also due to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, will say. Marcus is likely to get a frosty reception from Democratic lawmakers who already believe the company is too large and careless with consumer data. He is also likely to face skepticism from Republicans after President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also voiced concerns. They’re going to have to convince us of very high standards before they have access to the US financial system, Mnuchin said on Monday. UNDER WRAPS Facebook allocated a small fraction of its vast workforce to work on the project, Kevin Weil, who runs product for the Libra initiative, told Reuters on June 18. One former employee told Reuters the company tried to keep the project under wraps even internally – staff who were not involved knew little about it, not even that it was operating under the name Libra. Rumors had surfaced as early as last year that Facebook was working on a digital currency, but news that the project was in its advanced stages started to emerge only in recent months. In the weeks leading up to the announcement, the company began reaching out formally to key regulators including the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But two people with knowledge of the discussions said the conversations remained vague, with key details of the project discussed only on a theoretical level. Some lawmakers specializing in financial services policy have been frustrated by the lack of clarity from Facebook before and since June 18, three congressional sources said. For example, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee sent Facebook a letter on May 9 seeking information, including how the company would protect consumers’ financial information.

India delays lunar mission due to ‘technical’ embarrassment,"BENGALURU: India’s space agency said it delayed the launch of its second lunar mission, Chandrayaan-2, in the early hours of Monday due to a technical snag which was observed less than an hour before the scheduled liftoff. A technical snag was observed in launch vehicle system at T-56 minute, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), said in a tweet. As a measure of abundant precaution, Chandrayaan2 launch has been called off for today. The mission, which the ISRO chairman said is the most complex mission it has ever undertaken, was scheduled to launch at 09:21 p.m. GMT, or 02:51 a.m. local time on the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) Mark III rocket. ISRO said it will announce the revised launch date later. India successfully carried out its first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, nearly 11 years ago. The 10-billion rupee ($146 million) mission, if successful, would boost India’s aspirations to catch up with global space leaders the United States and China and put it in a better position to compete in the commercial space market. Success would make India only the fourth country behind the United States, Russia, and China to perform a soft or controlled, landing on the moon and put a rover on it. This would be the third attempted moon landing this year after China’s successful Chang’e-4 lunar probe and Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, which failed and crashed on to the moon in April. REUTERS.

Trump rips tech firms at ‘free speech’ summit,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump welcomed prominent conservative social media provocateurs to the White House on Thursday and said that along with himself, they are being treated unfairly by big tech firms, which he says suppress conservative voices. Trump said he has told his administration to look for regulations and legislation that could protect free speech – though he did not provide details on what measures were being discussed – and said he would summon major social firms to the White House for talks in coming weeks. We’re not going to be silenced, Trump said, complaining about fluctuations in the number of his Twitter followers. Big tech must not censor the voices. Freedom of speech is enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution. Trump, who regularly lashes out at the mainstream news media for their work which he brands as fake news, made social media a key part of his 2016 run for office as well as his 2020 reelection campaign. But he and other Republicans have long claimed that online platforms employ tactics to silence their voices, allegations that major social media companies have denied. Dozens of pro-Trump online personalities convened in the stately East Room to discuss what they say is censorship on social media platforms, rubbing elbows with several members of Trump’s cabinet and his White House team, and his son Donald Trump, Jr. Amid the sea of suits, several red Trump campaign hats and rubber bracelets popped out. Singer Joy Villa, who describes herself as a conservative activist, wore a flamboyant stars-and-stripes formal gown. Trump called to the stage Lila Rose, an anti-abortion activist who has been blocked from Pinterest; California lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, who has represented conservatives in free-speech lawsuits; and Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, sisters and video bloggers who are better known as Diamond and Silk. Carpe Donktum, a pro-Trump online persona who was recently suspended by Twitter for eight days over a video depicting Trump as a cowboy attacking CNN journalist Jim Acosta, said the face-to-face event could unite online conservatives. In freewheeling remarks that bounced from one topic to another – not unlike his Twitter feed followed by more than 61 million people – Trump talked about the power of social media, and railed against the traditional media standing at the back of the room. We hardly do press releases anymore, Trump said. If I put it out on social media, it’s like an explosion. IT’S GENIUS – BUT IT’S BAD Trump acknowledged criticism about the online behavior of some conservative users of social media. Some of you guys are out there – but even you should have a voice, Trump said. The crap you think of is unbelievable, he said. I mean it’s genius – but it’s bad. Trump more than once has threatened retaliatory action related to free speech. In March he signed an executive order requiring US colleges and universities to maintain free speech on campus if they want to continue receiving federal research funds, and last September he suggested that the license of television network NBC could be challenged over its news reporting. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, said that instead of focusing on combating Russian social media misinformation, punishing anti-competitive practices, or protecting Americans’ data and privacy, the president has invited trolls, conspiracy theorists, anti-Semites, and the whole comments section to the White House. Trump said he might invite some of the conservative social media users back to the White House for the meeting with major social media firms. Three tech officials said they had no knowledge of the meeting before Trump announced it. Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to comment on Trump’s announcement that he would bring them to the White House for a meeting. The Internet Association, a trade group representing major tech firms like Facebook, Twitter and Google, said, Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect. Republicans in Congress have held numerous hearings on the issue of alleged conservative bias on social media outlets. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who is working on proposed legislation on the issue, took the stage briefly on Thursday to air his complaints. They’ve gotten rich off of their special privileges from government. They want to keep those, they shouldn’t discriminate. They shouldn’t censor, Hawley said. A Senate panel chaired by Republican Ted Cruz on Tuesday will hold a hearing titled Google and Censorship through Search Engines featuring Google’s vice president of public policy, Karan Bhatia.

Anti-polio campaign to commence in various parts of the country today,"As part of the government’s renewed efforts to eradicate polio, anti-polio campaigns are set to start in various parts on the country — including Lahore, Khyber Pakhtunkhawa and Balochistan — on Monday. The campaigns of various lengths will span over the next 7 days. Previous attempts at such campaigns and the use of the anti-polio vaccine have been met with resistance amongst some parts of the country which has led to many children not being vaccinated against the disease. This lack of control has caused Pakistan to be one of three remaining nations — the other two being Afghanistan and Nigeria — that are still battling polio. Most recently, five new cases of polio have brought the total number up to 58 this year. This indicating a sudden increase of 383.33 per cent from last year’s figure of 12. Last week, Prime Minister Imran Khan showed serious concern over the recent rise in polio cases in the country and directed federal and provincial government officials to embark on creating effective awareness and immunisation campaigns so that the disease can be kept in check. The premier also announced that he will start leading the polio programme from November. Lahore Today marks the first day of the anti-polio campaign in the city. According to District Commissioner Saleh Saeed, the campaign will run from the August 26 to August 28, during which polio drops will be administered to 18.5 million children. More than 5000 teams are participating in the campaign in order to ensure that the vaccine reaches as many children as possible. Saeed said that the assistant commissioners and sub-registrars will be present to monitor the teams and ensure the efficiency of the campaign. To prevent unrest and ensure the safety of the polio workers, strict security arrangements have also been put in place for the teams. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will also see a three-day anti-polio drive, which was inaugurated by Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Anti-Polio Measures Babar Bin Atta earlier today at the Police Lines Hospital. During the course of the campaign — which will cover 27 districts in the region — over 3 million children are expected to be vaccinated against polio. 44 cases of polio – out of 58 – were reported from KP and the province has been experiencing outbreaks since October 2018. It is also the region that has exhibited the most resistance against the polio vaccine with incidents of parents putting false markings on their children to avoid the vaccine. Balochistan A seven-day campaign against polio will be launched in Naseerabad, Jaffarabad, Jhal Magsi and Sohbat Pur districts this week, Radio Pakistan reported. During this time, more than 1 million children will be given anti-polio drops. The campaign, overseen by Provincial Coordinator of Polio Emergency Operation Centre, Rashid Razzaq, will consist of 4000 teams which will administer polio drops to children at the doorstep.

Two million Muslims begin annual Hajj from today,"MAKKAH: More than two million Muslims began the annual Hajj on Friday. According to official statistics issued by Saudi General Directorate of Passports, 1.604 million pilgrims arrived in Saudi Arabia for Hajj, an increase of eight per cent or 117,000 pilgrims compared to the same period in 2018. In Makkah and other holy sites, the Saline Water Conversion Corporation, SWCC, aims to achieve a new record in 2019, by supplying one million cubic metres of potable water per day during the Hajj season, an increase of 10 per cent compared to 2018. In Mina, an area of eight-square kilometres has been allocated to some 45,000 tents, to provide accommodation for 1.5 million pilgrims. The area can host 118,000 people per hour and accommodate 70,000 worshipers. Some 141,800 pilgrims who arrived on 355 flights also benefited from the Makkah Route initiative — a service launched by the Kingdom that includes issuing visas, ensuring compliance with health requirements, and codifying and sorting luggage at airports in the pilgrims’ own countries. All of the arms of state have been deployed (and) we are proud to serve as ‘God’s hosts’, said security forces spokesman Bassam Attia. In total some 2.5 million faithful, the majority from abroad, will undertake the pilgrimage this year, according to local media. More than 1.8 million visas were delivered online without the need for middlemen. It’s a success, said Hajj ministry official Hatim bin Hassan Qadi. We feel cleansed by achieving this pillar of Islam and meeting people from across the world. It’s marvellous, said Mohamed Jaafar, a 40-year-old Egyptian pilgrim. ‘An indescribable feeling’
It’s an indescribable feeling. You have to live it to understand it, said an Algerian in his fifties completing the pilgrimage for the first time. It’s a golden opportunity and moment, said his female companion. Makkah, built in a desert valley, is home to the Kaaba, a cube structure that is the focal point of Islam and draped in a gold-embroidered black cloth. Muslims around the world pray towards the Kaaba, which is located in the Grand Mosque, and pilgrims walk around it seven times. Worshippers will participate in weekly prayers late on Friday morning. During the pilgrimage, separate streams of men and women, grouped by nationality, will travel to Mina on foot or in buses provided by the authorities. A district of Makkah, Mina sits in a narrow valley surrounded by rocky mountains and is transformed each year into a vast encampment for pilgrims. A total of 350,000 air-conditioned tents have been pitched, said a Saudi official. The hajj is one of the world’s largest religious gatherings. Photo: AFP
Worshippers will climb Mount Arafat, also known as the Mount of Mercy, for hours of prayers and Quran recitals. After descending, they will gather pebbles and perform the symbolic stoning of the devil. That marks the beginning of Eid-ul-Azha, the festival of sacrifice, marked on Sunday. Pilgrims then return to the Grand Mosque to perform a final tawaf or walk around the Kaaba. The scale of the pilgrimage presents vast security and logistical challenges, with tens of thousands of safety officers deployed. The Hajj, one of the world’s largest religious gatherings, is one of Islam’s five pillars and must be undertaken by all Muslims with the means at least once in their lives.

COAS calls for public-private partnership in Pakistan’s defence industry,"Web Desk – (Syed Ahad Hussain) RAWALPINDI: Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Friday stressed on the need for enhanced cooperation between the public and private sectors to transform Pakistan’s defence industry into a vibrant, self-reliant and self-sustained entity. The Army Chief, while addressing the two-day national seminar Defence Production – Security through Self Reliance being held at the Army Auditorium in Rawalpindi, said that apart from public sector and defence production organisations, a fully integrated private sector was much needed in Pakistan’s defence industry. COAS added, there is a need to amplify indigenization through fully integrated public and private organizations in defence production for meaningful progression in the defence of the country. Gen Bajwa thanked participants for giving time to an important issue concerning national security. The seminar was aimed to pave way for self-reliance by exploring indigenous defence production potential, identifying organisational and institutional challenges of the defence industry, pragmatic solutions to optimise defence production, and recommending policy level measures to have the private sector fully immersed in defence production, said the official press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). Participants of the seminar included members from different ministries, public and private organisations, chambers of commerce and industries, defence production establishments, and members from academia. The representatives from the public sector suggested ways forward for public-private partnership in defence production, according to the military media wing. Minister for Defence Production Zobaida Jalal and Minister for Science and Technology Chaudary Fawad Hussain shared their views and suggestions for the development of Pakistan’s defence industry into a prolific entity. Representatives from the private sector also shared a roadmap for enhancing public-private partnership in defence production. Advisor to PM on Commerce, Abdul Razak Dawood, showed the participants importance of an independent defence industry for national security. The establishment of a taskforce under Prime Minister Imran Khan for a roadmap to facilitate indigenous defence production, establishing a raw material industry, incorporating the private sector for raw material base so as to optimally utilise public sector capacity for indigenous defence production, surplus defence potential for export, establishing ‘Digital Parks’ to tap software industry potential, and promoting research and development in universities were among the key recommendations.

The court ruled, a man who intends to contract another marriage during the subsistence of an existing marriage has to observe the procedure and fulfill the conditions prescribed by the legislature otherwise the consequences of imprisonment or fine or both could ensue. According to Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961: During the subsistence of an existing marriage, no man shall contract another marriage except with the previous permission in writing of the arbitration council. According to Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961: During the subsistence of an existing marriage, no man shall contract another marriage except with the previous permission in writing of the arbitration council. The IHC was hearing a case related to a Kashmiri citizen Liaquat Ali Mir’s acquittal, declaring its earlier decision null and void. Under the Muslim Family Law Ordinance 1961, the person doing second marriage without permission is liable to punishment and fine, stated the court. The factors required to be taken into consideration by the Arbitration Council in granting permission for contracting a subsequent marriage have been prescribed in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 6 of the Ordinance of 1961. Making it mandatory to obtain permission from the Arbitration Council for an already married man before contracting a subsequent marriage, the court ruled, a husband who contracts another marriage during the subsistence of an earlier one in contravention of the provisions of the Ordinance of 1961 definitely exposes himself of the risk of being imprisoned or fined or to both. The court made it evident that despite the first wife’s agreement if the arbitration council disagrees with the decision then the person will be liable to punishment.

Former Premier Benazir Bhutto’s 66th birth anniversary today,"The 66th birth anniversary of Pakistan’s iconic former prime minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto is being celebrated today. Benazir was born on 21st June 1953 in Karachi to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto. She belonged to an influential political family which became a dynasty in Pakistan. She left for the esteemed Harvard University at the age of 16 to pursue her higher education. After receiving her undergraduate degree at Harvard, she got enrolled in England’s Oxford University. The political situation of Pakistan was turbulent at the time when the former prime minister was acquiring her education. Her father, who was heavily criticized by the political right over his reforms and nationalization of industries, was imprisoned and hanged by military ruler General Zia-ul-Haq on a murder charge in 1979. After Bhutto’s hanging, Benazir led a movement for restoration of democracy in Pakistan against the military rule. She was put under house arrest and was exiled later. She settled in London where she continued to oppose the military dictator. Benazir’s youngest brother, Shahnawaz Bhutto, was mysteriously killed in 1985 in an apartment in France. She returned to Pakistan only to be held for allegedly inciting the masses against the government.  The political scenario of the country received shockwaves when she announced her return to Pakistan in 1986. Hundreds of thousands of people arrived at Lahore to greet her and the movement against the military government of General Zia started to gain momentum. General Zia was killed in a plane crash in Bahawalpur on 17th August 1988 and the interim rulers called general elections in the country. At the age of 35 years, Benazir Bhutto was elected the Prime Minister of Pakistan after Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) emerged victorious in the polls. She holds the honor to be the first woman Head of Government of any Muslim country. However, her government was dismissed by than president Ghulam Ishaq Khan on allegations of corruption and mismanagement in August 1990. She was again re-elected as Prime Minister in 1993. Her aim was to make Pakistan a progressive country with equal opportunity for all citizens. Things did not turn out smoothly as Benazir wanted. In her second tenure, her brother Mir Murtaza Bhutto emerged as a fierce opponent of Benazir led government. He was slain in a police encounter in Karachi during her reign in 1996. Bhutto was again dismissed from office in 1996 and the Parliament was dissolved whereas her husband Asif Ali Zardari was imprisoned for many years. She again went into exile where she continued her fight for democracy. She decided to return to Pakistan on 18th October, 2007 despite grave threat to her life from rightist militant groups. She was greeted by a crowd of hundreds of thousands on her home-coming in Karachi. However, the celebration turned into grief as her welcome procession was attacked by twin suicide blasts at Karsaz in Karachi. The attack left more than a 100 people dead. Weeks before the general elections in the country, she targeted in a gun and bomb attack when she was returning after addressing an election rally at Liaquat Bagh of Rawalpindi. The attack in which she was killed with scores of her party activists, jolted the political landscape of the country and triggered a frenzy of anarchy and arson attacks that was resulted in billions of rupees losses to the country. Benazir Bhutto is considered one of the most dynamic figures in the world politics and her struggle for democracy was posthumously honored and acknowledged in the world. On the night of 5 August 2009, while he was staying with his second wife at his father-in-law’s house in Zangara, a US drone attacked the premises subsequently killing the main perpetrator who supposedly carried out the attack but questions still remain unanswered and Pakistan’s hierarchy is yet to produce facts to the general public. Benazir’s son and PPP chairperson, on Friday said Benazir was a great daughter of this motherland. Despite of being elected PM twice, her government was eradicated. Shaheed Bibi promoted mutual understanding between the federacy and the provinces, he added. PPP is following her mission and the day is not far away when the sun of truth will rise which was irrigated by Bibi, Bilawal further added.

China’s panda diplomacy puts a smile on ‘best friend’ Putin’s face,"Chinese President Xi Jinping presented two pandas to Moscow’s zoo at a ceremony with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, in a gesture the Russian president described as a sign of deepening trust and respect between the two powers. Xi unveiled the pandas – Ru Yi and Ding Ding – after talks with Putin whom he called his best friend at the start of a three-day visit that will see him attend Russia’s flagship economic forum in St Petersburg later this week. The pandas, who could be seen chomping bamboo as Xi and Putin arrived, will living in a specially built enclosure. Beijing has loaned them to Moscow for 15 years as part of a joint research project. Xi’s visit to Russia comes with Moscow’s ties with the West at post-Cold War lows and with Beijing’s relations with the United States strained over a trade war. Both powers are eager to show they are strengthening ties. The leaders promised to deepen military technical cooperation at talks in Moscow, while Russian and Chinese businesses signed an array of deals. Over the past six years we have met almost 30 times … Putin is my best friend and a good colleague, Xi said in comments published on the Kremlin’s website. Standing alongside Xi after the talks, Putin thanked China for entrusting the pandas to Moscow. This is a gesture of particular respect and trust in Russia. When we talk about pandas, we always end up with a smile on our faces. We accept this gift with great respect and gratitude, Putin said. These animals are a national symbol for China, and we greatly value this gesture of friendship, he said.

Pakistan makes into 4th among world’s fastest-growing freelance markets,"Pakistan has been ranked as the fourth fastest-growing freelance market with 47 per cent growth in freelance earning during the second quarter as compared to the same period of last year. According to the global payment platform Payoneer’s Global Gig Economy Index, published in Forbes, Pakistan was among the top freelance markets leaving behind regional countries including India, Bangladesh and Russia. The report was based on a sample of the more than 300,000 freelancers in Payoneer’s network. According to the report, the US stood at the top with 78 per cent growth followed by the UK at 59 per cent, Brazil 48 per cent, Pakistan 47 per cent, Ukraine 36 per cent, India 29 per cent, Bangladesh 27 per cent, Russia 20 per cent, and Serbia 19 per cent growth. The report observed that many freelancers in developing economies were young adults looking to get a foothold in a career. Pakistan, where many freelancers are under age 30, is a good example, it added. In Pakistan, there is a younger generation seeking more opportunities, said Eyal Moldovan, general manager of Payoneer. Payoneer’s research said that on a global level, the 35-44-year-old age group is doing the best at making money in freelancing. This group contributes 32 per cent of earnings even though it represents only 23 per cent of freelancers. The youngest cohort of freelancers, those aged 18-34, made up 64 per cent of freelancers but only earned 53 per cent of total earnings, it added. Those freelancers of 45-54 years age made up 9 per cent of freelancers and brought in 9.4 per cent of earnings, whereas those above 55 years made up 5 per cent of freelancers and brought in 4.9 per cent of earnings, the report revealed.

"E-cigarettes, ‘smoke-free’ products do not help reduce cancer: WHO","GENEVA: Electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products are not helping fight cancer, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday, urging smokers and governments not to trust claims from cigarette firms about their latest products. The seventh WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic said blocking the industry’s interference was critical to cutting the harm from tobacco use. The tobacco industry has a long history of systemic, aggressive, sustained and well-resourced opposition to tobacco control measures, the report said. While some strategies are public and others more covert… all have the goal of weakening tobacco control. The report said tobacco giant Philip Morris International was trying to position itself as a responsible public health partner via its Unsmoke campaign, which encourages people to change to a better alternative. The WHO said the campaign aimed to ensure tobacco remained socially acceptable, while confusing consumers with terms such as smoke-free products, which may refer to products with toxic emissions and unknown short-term and long-term health effects. Philip Morris spokesman Ryan Sparrow said the WHO’s message made it harder to provide safer options for people who cannot quit smoking. There is no question that the best choice for smokers is to quit cigarettes and nicotine altogether. The reality is many people do not. We cannot turn our backs on them, he said. Organisations like the World Health Organization need to stop talking at smokers and start listening. The WHO report said the industry hoped to win respectability through manipulative messages such as claiming their products were part of a harm reduction strategy, even though cigarettes still account for 97% of the global tobacco market. Vinayak Prasad, programme manager of WHO’s tobacco control unit, said development of new products was solely intended to expand the markets of tobacco firms. There is no difference between cigarettes and heated tobacco products except that in terms of exposure: the exposure is less and the smoke is not visible, he said. Electronic cigarettes, containing nicotine but not tobacco, were promoted as a way to quit smoking. But there was no evidence to justify the claim, and evidence from the United States showed they had increased the prevalence of young people smoking, he said. So it’s also a gateway for young people, Prasad said. The answer is it needs to be regulated. WHO has clear guidelines – to get electronic cigarettes regulated. And if you are banning it, fine, but if you aren’t banning it don’t let it (go) free in the market, because the young people are taking it up. REUTERS.

Injured Italian rescued by Pak Army after 48 hours on Karakoram peak,"ROME: Pakistani military helicopters have rescued an Italian climber 48 hours after he suffered serious injuries in a fall in the northern Karakoram mountains, officials said on Monday.

FaceApp viral amid fears of privacy,"You might want to think twice before you use viral selfie app FaceApp. The two-year-old app, which lets you alter photos of your face, once again shot to the App Store’s top spot this week after celebs and others began sharing doctored photos of themselves. Like some of Snapchat’s popular face filters, you can change photos of yourself so you appear older or younger, orswap genders. It’s a familiar gimmick at this point – and not one that’s new for FaceApp— but the app has gone viral all the same. It’s currently one of the most downloaded apps for both iOS and Android, as #faceappchallenge posts have taken over social media. But with the sudden surge in popularity have come new questions about privacy, and whether FaceApp is doing enough to protect users’ data. Some have questioned why the app, which has been out for years, suddenly went viral all over again seemingly overnight. Others have pointed to the fact that the app requires a data connection, suggesting that might be indicate the app is surreptitiously grabbing users’ photos. (Multiplesecurity researchershavesaidthere is no evidence that the app is sweeping up entire photo libraries.) And, in some corners of Twitter, people have pointed to the app’s Russian origins — FaceApp is owned by a company, Wireless Lab, that’s based in St. Petersburg — as a sign of something nefarious. While there’s as yet no evidence to support these claims, some other concerns are less far fetched. In a post-Cambridge Analytica world, in which thousands of people had their personal data misused because of a seemingly innocuous personality quiz, people are rightfully wary of the numerous ways their data could be accessed or exposed by an app developer.  And we don’t need to look far to find examples of photo apps taking their users’ photos for uses far beyond what’s required for their own apps. Earlier this year,NBC reportedthat Ever, a popular photo storage app, was using its users’ photos to train facial recognition software it then sold to law enforcement. IBM was also found to beusing Flickr photosto train facial recognition applications without permission from those in the photos. And last year, PopSugar’s viral twinning app inadvertentlyleaked data.

Theme based restaurants changing Islamabad’s food landscape,"ISLAMABAD: Young entrepreneurs have converted youth’s inclination of watching western TV series/seasons into an innovative business idea as the twin cities are witnessing an increase in theme-based restaurants. With detailed work on aesthetics and matching themes, the owners of these cafes make sure that visitors get the complete environment of their favourite TV shows while eating quality food with friends and family. Some of these famous restaurants include ‘King’s Landing café’ with the theme of hit American TV series ‘Games of Thrones’, ‘The Smokey Cauldron’ and ‘Café Crossbones’ with the theme of famous fiction series ‘Harry Potter’ while ‘Burnout Restaurant’s’ theme is based on famous film Cars. Owner of The Smokey Cauldron, Muhammad Haider Khan, told APP that the idea behind this café was to benefit from lack of such theme restaurants. We were the pioneer of this trend in the city as we wanted to create a nice place where Harry Potter fans can work on their laptops, maybe read a book and have a mug of coffee, he added. Most of the owners of these restaurants were fresh graduate engineers who were unable to find a good job so they put their creativity to good use. Game of Thrones-themed Café was the creative product of five young graduates, Qasim Bin Tariq, Ali Saif, Moiz Hashmi, Hammad Anwar and Arslan Sajid who graduated from FAST University with engineering degrees. We pursued our entrepreneurial venture after realizing that the formula for success is to provide modern-day consumers with a unique experience and memories associated with a product or service, Qasim said. He said they did not want to open just another café so they decided to do a experiment in their business with exploring the theme of hit TV show ‘Game of Thrones’ (GOT). ‘Burnout’ restaurant was also standing out as the first ‘Car themed’ restaurant in Pakistan based on the famous American film Cars. Talking to APP, the manager of the restaurant said they offered great ambience to their visitors with a unique interior that revolves around different features of the movie. We wanted to make sure that being the only car-themed café our visitors can get the feel of their favourite movie franchise’, he added. Ahmad, one of the visitors at Howdy, a cowboy-themed restaurant in F-7, said that having such creative eateries provide a sense of culture in the city. Islamabad may not have its own cuisine but this evolving culture of theme restaurants is serving us well. They present a lot of option to dine out on weekends in enjoyable ambience with friends and family, he said.

Last Volkswagen Beetle drives into the sunset,"PUEBLA: Volkswagen rolled the last Beetle off the assembly line on Wednesday, the end of the road for a car that ran from Nazi Germany through hippie counterculture but failed to navigate a swerve in consumer tastes toward SUVs. Serenaded by a mariachi band and surrounded by proud factory workers, the final units of the retro, rounded compact were celebrated at a VW plant in Mexico’s central Puebla state more than 80 years after the model was introduced in Germany. The Puebla factory, which already produces VW’s Tiguan SUV, will make the Tarek SUV in place of the Beetle starting in late 2020, Volkswagen de Mexico Chief Executive Steffen Reiche said. The bigger vehicles are more popular in the United States, the main export market for the Mexico factory. The last Beetles will be sold on Amazon.com in a move symbolizing the company’s embrace of the future, Reiche said. Today is the last day. It has been very emotional, he said. The current design was the third version of the Beetle after two earlier cancellations and revivals of the marque. The bug, as the Beetle was nicknamed, debuted in 1938 as an affordable vehicle commissioned by Adolf Hitler to promote car ownership among Germans. With its funky design and inexpensive price, the car became a success story over subsequent decades and was one of the top-selling models of all time as well as the best-selling import in the United States in the 1960s, according to auto publications. In the 1960s, the Beetle was a small-is-beautiful icon of the postwar Baby Boom generation. The 1968 movie The Love Bug, which featured a zany anthropomorphic vehicle, stoked Beetle fever. Despite its place in popular culture, sales of the Beetle have been lackluster in recent years. The German automaker announced in September that the Beetle would go extinct. REUTERS.

Chicken meat causing rising rates of PCOs across the world,"By: |Simra Shahab| Since 1955 had the most astounding scope of beef, mutton, and then chicken. Be that as it may, because of ascent of costs, people moved to chicken as it is the most reasonable type of meat utilization. Soon, chicken replaced mutton as the prices for mutton meat reached sky high and since the middle class crisis, the public shifted to chicken, beef and then mutton. The high rates of population increase since 1955 from 40 million to 2 billion today 2019 require considerable amount of meat production. Hence, Imran Khan contributed to a better plan for the future crisis with the ‘egg and chicken’ plan. For the colonised minds when desis talk about chickens combating poverty they get mocked, but when walaitis talk about desi chicken and poverty it’s brilliance! https://t.co/bjvQQIVoRv — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) December 1, 2018  Stats show us how poultry surpassed mutton in the nick of time ever since prices shook high. Not only that but it has affected the health of public, especially in women since chicken consumption is the most common, due to the reason stated above and the nutrients of meat and mutton are low, which is also the reason that 1 out of 5 people or children in general 1 have depleted hemoglobin levels. This issue shall be discussed in the latter part but first we need to know the root cause of how and why it happened. https://www.google.com/search?q=chart+of+meat+consumption+in+pakistan&rlz=1C1CHBD_enPK818PK818&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimo_zCg6XjAhUgVBUIHYD7A9kQ_AUIECgB&biw=1137&bih=675#imgrc=yh4n30R-4CRImM: How did Occur? Ever since the demand of chicken consumption, keeping in mind the population rise, the poultry industry had to make it up to the requirement. However, it wasn’t a simple task at all since in 1977 avian flu spread which led to the death of most of the parent flock. Nevertheless, Pakistan was especially successful in controlling exceedingly pathogenic avian flu. With help from the FAO, Pakistan set up a reference research facility and a countrywide checking program. The main episode of HPAI in Pakistan happened in 1995, when HPAI serotype H7N3 was accounted for in reproducing stocks from business poultry cultivating and brought about overwhelming mortality and a serious drop in egg generation. In 1999, another serotype of low pathogenic avian flu developed is as yet common all through the nation. The infection rose again in November 2003 in the southern city of Karachi, primarily influencing business layers. The infection was in the long run constrained by separating and immunization procedures before the finish of 2005. The infection returned in 2007 and 2008. Out and out 22 episodes, basically in rearing rushes, have been accounted for. From July 2008 to 2011, no new instances of H5N1 were recorded in Pakistan. https://hospitals.aku.edu/pakistan/diseases-and-conditions/Pages/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.aspx Demand and Drawbacks Stuck between demand and the flu prevailing really brought damage to the poultry industry. As indicated by Nazir (2013), Pakistan has not been effective in creating explicit pathogen free (SPF) chickens, and experiences high feed costs (Tauqir and Nawaz, 2001) alongside low quality feed containing elevated amounts of mycotoxins (Saeed et al., 2009). Taking this in account, farmers and breeders reached for a cost effective method by choosing cheaper feed and injections that boosts the growth of chicken sooner than the natural time. This does not only messes with nature but is harmful for consumption as well. A significant number of women have been diagnosed with PCO (Polycystic ovary syndrome) is a condition that affectsa woman’shormone levels.Women withPCOs develop hormonal imbalance that causes to trigger higher than normal amounts of male hormones. This not only causes them to skip menstrual periods but also makes it harder for them to get pregnant, which directly affects fertility. Since it has impacted a major chunk of Pakistanis, people are either opting for desi-chicken have started avoiding chicken meat in general. This may have a significant impact on the poultry industry as well as the ones who are still unaware of the harsh truth regarding the side effects of consuming chicken carried by the cow milk that is also the result of injections, and by no means it may be healthy. Is the Future safe? Still there are some poultry linked major problems exists in the country including seasonal price fluctuations, expansive and low-quality feed and different diseases of flocks especially bird flu. But as happened in the past, research is going on upon these issues and the researchers are optimistic that the issues will be resolved in the country in near future.

Japan sending patent officials to US over Kim Kardashian “Kimono” flap,"TOKYO: Japan is to send patent officials to the United States to discuss the flap over Kim Kardashian’s Kimono brand underwear, the trade minister said on Tuesday. The reality TV star and businesswoman said on Monday she would rename her Kimono shapewear line after people in Japan said her use of the term was disrespectful. Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said he was aware of Kardashian’s decision but still wanted there to be a careful examination of the matter. This has become a big deal on social media, Seko said during a regular press conference in Tokyo, adding that trademark issues fell under his jurisdiction. The kimono is regarded around the world as a distinct part of our culture, he said. Even in America, kimono is well known to be Japanese. Kardashian said that she had announced the Kimono products in June with the best intentions in mind and that she appreciated the feedback she had received. My brands and products are built with inclusivity and diversity at their core and after careful thought and consideration, I will be launching my Solutionwear brand under a new name, she wrote on Twitter. In Japanese, kimono means thing that’s worn and refers to full-length robes with sashes donned for formal occasions such as weddings and funerals. Kardashian’s use of the word on undergarments and filing for a trademark annoyed many people. Kimono is not underwear! Stop trademark registration! Don’t make the word kimono yours! Twitter user Ruu wrote shortly after the launch announcement, echoing a common theme. Others said using the word was a theft of traditional culture and begged Kardashian to change the name, saying the underwear would sell just as well if it was called something else. Seko said that he was sending Japanese patent executives to the US Patent and Trademark Office on July 9 to properly exchange views on the matter, adding that he would be following the situation closely.

France’s Mirazur crowned world’s best restaurant,"SINGAPORE: Mirazur, on the French Riviera, was crowned No.1 at the World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards ceremony held in Singapore on Tuesday, lauded for its fresh and seasonal cuisine. The three-Michelin-starred restaurant in Menton climbed to the top from third last year, replacing Italy’s Osteria Francescana. Mirazur’s menu, which includes dishes like salt-crusted beetroot from the garden with caviar cream, is inspired by the sea, the mountains and produce from its own gardens, which cascade over three levels. Its Argentine-born chef Mauro Colagreco told Reuters he felt like he was in the sky after winning the award, which showed the world when you have a dream all is possible. He and his team accepted the prize carrying a banner that combined the flags of Argentina, France, Brazil and Italy. Launched in 2002, the 50 Best list has grown in prominence to rival the long-established Michelin star system. The ceremony in Singapore is the first to be held in Asia. After a change in the rules earlier this year, restaurants that previously topped the poll will no longer be eligible for the annual ranking. Past winners, including Osteria Francescana, joined a newly created Best of the Best category. René Redzepi’s re-opened Noma in Copenhagen, Denmark, debuted on the 2019 list at No. 2. In its previous incarnation, Noma won the top title in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014. Spain dominated the top 10 list with three restaurants. Asador Etxebarri in Axpe was ranked No.3 for showing off simple ingredients by grilling them, while Mugaritz was seventh and Disfrutar came ninth. Compiled by William Reed Business Media, the Best 50 list is based on the experiences of more than 1,000 restaurant industry experts around the world. The only Asian restaurant in the top 10 was Gaggan in Bangkok, Thailand, at No. 4. Kolkata-born chef Gaggan Anand’s playful menu includes a curry dish that diners are encouraged to lick from the plate, while music by rock band Kiss plays in the background. Another Copenhagen restaurant, Geranium, was fifth on the list, while Paris’s Arpège, where vegetables take center-stage, was No. 8. Peru, which has emerged in recent years as a top culinary destination, featured twice in the top 10 — Lima’s Central remained sixth, while Japanese-Peruvian fusion outlet Maido, with its 50-hour-cooked beef short rib, was No. 10.

"Raw, fried or on a bun: the many ways Japan eats whale","MINAMIBOSO: Whale cutlets, sliced raw whale, deep-fried whale nuggets, whale bacon and whale jerky feature on the menu at the restaurant Yoko Ichihara runs – and that’s just a small sample of the ways Japan eats whale. Though Japan’s government maintains that eating whale is a cherished part of its food culture, nationwide consumption didn’t really take off until after World War Two and peaked in the early 1960s before falling as other protein sources became cheaply available. A 1986 global whaling moratorium made whale a pricey food that rarely appears on family tables or in ordinary supermarkets, with vendors relying on Japan’s scientific research whaling for their supply. Japan resumes commercial whaling on July 1. A lot of people came in after hearing that the research whaling had ended, worried that they couldn’t get whale anymore, Ichihara said. They were surprised to hear whale is taken in Japan too. True aficionados have endured, sating their whale cravings largely through speciality restaurants such as the one Ichihara, 42, operates in Minamiboso, just east of Tokyo. Traditional recipes include blubber with vinegar-miso sauce, thinly sliced whale tongue, whale steak, a hotpot where slices of whale meat are simmered with mizuna greens and, the simplest, raw whale dipped in soy sauce. Several restaurants have come up with whaleburgers, a patty of whale meat sandwiched between buns or pressed rice. Ichihara’s restaurant offers many of these, as well as a unique take on traditional whale treats: fried whale dressed with slivered vegetables and vinegar, grilled marinated whale steak, and raw whale chopped with miso and scallions. Aficionados say whale tastes somewhat like beef, but with a stronger flavor. Whaling advocates point to its high protein content and low carbon footprint compared with other meats. Ichihara’s mother-in-law, Yachiyo, praises it as an ideal food. When it’s in your mouth, it’s meat, but when it’s in your stomach it’s like fish, it’s light, she said. Whale represents only 0.1 per cent of Japan’s meat consumption, so proponents say getting the next generation to eat it is essential. Schools occasionally serve it for lunch, including some – like those in Chigasaki, a city west of Tokyo that is not a traditional whaling area – as a way of teaching children what people ate in the past. To make it appealing to students, whale is usually served as fried nuggets, often with a soy-ginger sauce or ketchup, said Emi Yamaguchi, at the Chigasaki Board of Education. Since it’s such a rare thing, it’d be too bad to have lots left over, she said. It’s a special event so the kids are excited, and we make it in ways that appeal to them. The Ichiharas have taken part in whale-cooking contests to develop new dishes, with prizes going to items such as whale-filled spring rolls. A Minamiboso roadside store stocks whale-stuffed Chinese buns and whale ham along with more traditional items and cookies sold in boxes decorated with whales. REUTERS.

Teenager who called UK’s Prince Harry ‘race traitor’ is jailed,"LONDON: A teenage neo-Nazi who called for Britain’s Prince Harry a race traitor months after his marriage to US actress Meghan Markle and suggested he should be shot was jailed for more than four years on Tuesday, the BBC reported. Michal Szewczuk, 19, posted far-right online propaganda which included an image of Harry, the Duke of Sussex, with a gun to his head with the caption See Ya Later Race Traitor. It was posted months after his wedding to Meghan, whose mother is African American and father is white. Szewczuk and his co-defendant Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, 18, both Polish nationals, pleaded guilty to encouraging terrorism and Szewczuk also admitted five counts of possessing material likely to be useful to someone planning a terrorist act. Dunn-Koczorowski and Szewczuk clearly see themselves as superior to the majority of society and they feel there duty is to express their beliefs, in turn teaching others, Detective Chief Superintendent Martin Snowden, head of counter-terrorism policing in northeast England. The considerable amount of material they have posted on social media channels not only reflects their extremist beliefs but was intended to encourage others to carry out despicable acts. Szewczuk was jailed for four years and three months while Dunn-Koczorowski was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Other posts by the men included support for Norwegian far-right mass killer Anders Breivik and backing for the neo-Nazi group, Sonnenkrieg Division. REUTERS.

Japan’s #KuToo campaign seeks ban on requiring women to wear high heels at work,"TOKYO: Japan’s health minister said in response to a petition seeking a ban on requiring women to wear high heels at work that such dress code expectations are necessary and appropriate in the workplace. Health Minister Takumi Nemoto responded on Wednesday to an online campaign gaining attention in Japan under the hashtag #KuToo, a play on the Japanese words for shoe, kutsu, and pain, kutsuu. The petition, which has collected 21,000 online signatures and is still growing, was submitted on Monday to the health ministry by Yumi Ishikawa, a 32-year-old funeral parlour worker. She said on Twitter in January she was required to wear 5-7 centimetre (2-3 inch) heels at work, causing her feet to hurt. Many Japanese companies may not explicitly require female employees to wear high heels but many women do so because of tradition and social expectations. I think it’s within the range of what’s commonly accepted as necessary and appropriate in the workplace, Nemoto said in response to a question from an opposition lawmaker in a parliamentary committee. However, Nemoto also said it could be considered power harassment if employers required female workers who had been injured to wear high heels. Ishikawa said on Thursday Nemoto’s comments had pushed the issue even more into the spotlight and wanted people to debate the issue seriously. It seems like men don’t really understand that wearing high heels can be painful and lead to injuries, she told Reuters. But even if women aren’t hurt, I’d like such expectations to be considered power harassment, she said. Ishikawa said Nemoto’s remarks might prompt some women to bring the issue up with their bosses. This might spur that kind of action, so I think this is going in a good direction, she said. The health ministry said it was reviewing the petition and declined to comment further.

"Meet ‘Digit’, the walking robot for Ford self-driving vans","Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it was partnering with walking robots maker Agility Robotics as it designs a planned fleet of self-driving delivery vans that will drop packages at the doorsteps of people’s homes. The United States’ second largest carmaker has been moving steadily on the development of full-service autonomous driving vans which it could potentially license out to companies ranging from Domino’s Pizza to Lyft or Target. It launched a self-driving pilot with delivery partners including Domino’s in Miami last year, and it said it was working on the best way to integrate Agility’s two-legged robot, Digit, into future vans. Digit is capable of lifting packages that weigh up to 40 pounds, can walk up and down stairs and through uneven terrain, while maintaining its balance after being bumped, Ford said. It’s not always convenient for people to leave their homes to retrieve deliveries, Ken Washington, Ford’s chief technology officer, said. If we can free people up to focus less on the logistics of making deliveries, they can turn their time and effort to things that really need their attention. After Ford bought Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based self-driving startup in 2017, the company has taken aim at providing autonomous vehicle service to multiple partners, who in turn would offer it to their customers under their own brand names. A Lyft customer, for instance, could schedule a ride from a Lyft mobile phone app in a Ford self-driving vehicle. But with spiraling development costs for autonomous cars in recent years, the company and other carmakers have sought alliances and outside investors. Ford has been in talks with Germany’s Volkswagen AG for an investment in the Argo unit, potentially saving billions in development costs. REUTERS.

McDonald’s faces 25 new sexual harassment lawsuits,"McDonald’s Corp has been accused in 25 new legal actions of condoning sexual harassment in the workplace and retaliating against employees who speak up. The new charges and lawsuits against one of the world’s most recognizable brands were announced on Tuesday by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the labor group Fight for $15, and the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, which wants to expand the #MeToo movement beyond prominent figures in Hollywood and elsewhere. McDonald’s said it has more than 14,000 locations in the United States, over 90 percent of which are franchised, with some 850,000 workers. The Chicago-based company has also long said it should not be liable for how employees in franchised restaurants behave. In letters sent this week to Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth and Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi, who is supporting the workers’ cause, McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the fast food chain has improved and more clearly defined its harassment policies, and trained most franchise owners. McDonald’s is sending a clear message that we are committed to creating and sustaining a culture of trust where employees feel safe, valued and respected, Easterbrook wrote. The ACLU said the legal actions include three new civil rights lawsuits, two lawsuits by workers who previously filed charges, and charges filed by workers across the country with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. More than 50 such charges and lawsuits have been filed against McDonald’s in the last three years, the ACLU said. REUTERS.

SRINAGAR: The crisis of humanity has reached an alarming proportion in Indian Occupied Kashmir as the lockdown entered 26th day.
According to KMS, India has stepped up its state terrorism in the occupied territory increasing its brutalities against the innocent Kashmiris. It has turned the Kashmir valley into a big open-air jail and a hell for its inhabitants.
Confined to their homes, the residents of the valley are facing acute shortage of edibles, baby food and life-saving drugs due to the curfew and restrictions, which entered 26th day, today.

 The occupation authorities continue to impose severe communication blackout by snapping all internet, mobile and landline services and closing the TV channels to hide the ground situation from the world. Local newspapers not only failed to hit the stands but also could not even update their online editions during all these days.
Schools in the Kashmir valley continue to remain shut as parents are not ready to risk the lives of their children in the prevailing grim situation. At the same time, the authorities continue a massive crackdown against Hurriyat leaders, political workers and youth.
More than 10,000 people have been arrested so far and detained in jails, police stations and makeshift detention centres.

Trump’s personal assistant steps down,"
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s personal assistant Madeleine Westerhout resigned on Thursday after she shared information about the president’s family with journalists, US media reported.
Westerhout’s unexpected departure came after Trump learned that she had talked about his family and White House matters with reporters at an off-the-record session during the president’s recent working vacation in New Jersey, The New York Times reported citing unnamed sources.
Later, other outlets — including CNN and Politico — also reported her departure citing unnamed sources.

 CNN said Westerhout had failed to make clear during the interaction with journalists that her comments were off the record, and one reporter disclosed the conversation to the White House.
Westerhout’s office was in front of the Oval Office and she had been described as Trump’s “gatekeeper” in US media. She had been his personal assistant from the beginning of his presidency.
The Trump administration has been particularly sensitive about staff leaking information to the media, with the president railing against both officials and journalists over reports about the state of affairs in the White House.
The New York Times said Westerhout was now a “separated employee” and would not be allowed into the White House.
A former administration official described Trump and Westerhout’s relationship as “close”, CNN said, but added that talking about his family was “a red line”.
Westerhout was not a high-profile staffer, but her exit adds to a long list of administration officials who have quit since Donald Trump was elected president in 2016.

"Warsaw, Washington agree on locations for new U.S. troops in Poland: minister","
WARSAW: Warsaw and Washington have agreed on six locations for new U.S. troops to be stationed in Poland, the country’s Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Friday, a day after Donald Trump canceled a trip to the eastern European nation.
Trump called off his weekend trip due to a hurricane bearing down on Florida, with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to take his place at events in Poland to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the start of World War Two.
“We have agreed on six locations, we talked about a seventh location,” Blaszczak said later at a joint news conference with U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has come to Poland for the anniversary.

 In June, Poland signed a deal to increase the American military presence on its soil to counter Russia’s growing assertiveness since its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
Poland has a border in the northeast with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, where Moscow has deployed advanced nuclear-capable Iskander missiles.
The military deal signed in June will increase the number of non-permanent U.S. troops in Poland by 1,000. There are on average about 4,500 U.S. troops in Poland on rotation as part of NATO forces.
“Poland has been an outstanding partner of the U.S. and NATO, spending more than 2% of GDP on defense,” Bolton told the conference. He added that Trump’s visit will be rescheduled as soon as possible.
Apart from declarations about military cooperation, some analysts had expected Trump to comment on energy and technology cooperation, and possibly on easing U.S. visa requirements for Poles.
An aide to Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Thursday that Trump may visit in the coming months.
“Probably some part of the declarations, which only the U.S. president can make, will be delayed (…) and probably some of the declarations will wait for his visit to Warsaw,” minister at Polish president’s chancellery Krzysztof Szczerski told public radio.
He did not reply directly to questions about relaxing the visa regime, saying only that there are talks about Polish-US “cooperation”.

France to begin one-month no deal Brexit dress rehearsal,"
PARIS: France will test run measures it has prepared for Britain’s exit from Europe for a month so that companies are fully-prepared ahead of Britain leaving the bloc at the end of October, its minister in charge of customs said on Friday.
Gerald Darmanin will meet Michael Gove, the British minister in charge of coordinating ‘no-deal’ Brexit planning, in Calais later on Friday to show how France is preparing for Britain’s departure from the EU on Oct. 31.
Businesses have been warning of long tailbacks for lorries transporting goods between mainland Europe and Britain, and the British government has said most goods from the EU will be allowed into Britain without full customs checks for at least three months if there is a no deal Brexit.

 “For a month we will act as if there is Brexit for a large number of companies. We’re going to put in place a sort of general rehearsal so that we are ready at the end of October,” Darmanin told RTL radio.
Some 700 extra customs officers have been drafted in and authorities will also introduce online border declarations forcing companies to announce their goods prior to arriving at the border.
“You are in Grenoble (eastern France), you are an a small or medium-sized company, you export to Britain and so you now declare everything online,” Darmanin said.
“There will be barcodes and numbered plates or merchandise … and without stopping at the border, your goods will go directly to Britain. There will be no queues of tens and tens of kilometers.”
France is the EU’s biggest agricultural producer and exports large amounts of wine, spirits and dairy products to Britain, while relying on its neighbour’s waters to sustain its fishing industry.

Hunters turn gamekeepers to help C. Africa’s threatened wildlife,"
Jean moves deftly through the tangle of roots and branches before waiting for the rainforest to give him a clue.
In the heart of the Dzanga-Sangha wildlife reserve in western Central African Republic, the Pygmy hunter is looking for the tracks of a large female elephant he has been following for the last three hours.
The elephant is not Jean’s prey, but rather the opposite.

 He is part of a force of local hunters who have trained to become rangers. Their mission: to protect the park’s precious animals from ruthless poachers.
Lying on the flanks of the Sangha River, the 4,000-square-kilometre (1,500-square-mile) park, created in 1990, is the CAR’s last haven for elephants and Central African gorillas.

Luis Arranz of the environment group WWF, which runs the park in partnership with the CAR government, is worried that this precious refuge will also fall one day.
“It won’t last,” he predicts sadly.
He points to the potential booty for poachers from ivory tusks, giraffe skins, pangolin scales and gorilla meat.
Scientists, with the help of the Pygmy rangers, are moving through the park to draw up an inventory of the major species.
A team accompanying Jean followed the trace of the female elephant to a large, swampy clearing, where about 100 elephants were gathered, rummaging for salt with the tip of their trunks.

Poor and chronically unstable, the CAR has been wracked by civil strife since 2013. Poaching — facilitated by porous borders, negligible policing and voracious Asian demand — has been the big benefactor.
Ecofaune, a conservation NGO for the north of the country, estimates that the population of large mammals in Dzanga-Sangha has fallen by a catastrophic 94 percent over the last three decades.

Arranz is stricken by the loss.
“Giraffes have disappeared from the north, rhinos too. There are no more savanna elephants either,” he says gloomily. “The poachers are bound to come here one day.”

Brazil’s burning ban takes effect as Amazon fires rage,"
A 60-day ban on burning in Brazil took effect Thursday after a global outcry over fires raging in the Amazon and data showing hundreds of new blazes in the rainforest.
The decree issued by President Jair Bolsonaro comes after escalating international pressure over the worst fires in the Amazon in years, which have ignited a diplomatic spat between Brazil and Europe.
But activists quickly doused hopes that the ban would work.

 “The people who burn without a license are not going to obey,” said Rodrigo Junqueira of the Socio-Environmental Institute.
Thousands of troops and firefighters have been deployed since the weekend to combat the fires, along with two C-130 Hercules and other aircraft that are dumping water over affected areas in the country’s north.
Police on Thursday arrested three people for burning more than 5,000 hectares (12,350 acres) in a conservation area in Para state.
More than 1,600 new fires were ignited between Tuesday and Wednesday, taking this year’s total to almost 85,000 — the highest number since 2010, official data shows. Around half of them are in the vast Amazon basin.

Bolsonaro, however, claimed in a live broadcast on Facebook that “this year’s fires are below the average of recent years.”
UN chief Antonio Guterres on Thursday mooted a meeting of key countries to drum up support to tackle the fires that have also devastated swaths of Bolivia.
“We are strongly appealing for the mobilization of resources and we have been in contact with countries to see whether, during the high-level session of the General Assembly, there could be a meeting devoted to the mobilization of support to the Amazon,” Guterres told reporters.

Brazil’s foreign ministry said it was not aware of the proposal.
It urged “foreign authorities” to learn more about the country’s environmental policies, the situation in the Amazon and measures taken to combat the fires “before proposing new initiatives.”

"US to keep 8,600 troops in Afghanistan after deal with Taliban, says Trump","
President Donald Trump on Thursday said that United States troop levels in Afghanistan will drop to 8,600 if a deal is reached with the Afghan Taliban and that a permanent presence will remain.
“We’re going down to 8,600 and then we make a determination from there,” Trump said in an interview withFox Newsradio. “We’re always going to have a presence.”
Trump also said that if another attack on the US originated from Afghanistan “we would come back with a force like […] never before.”

 US troops were first sent to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on US soil carried out by Al Qaeda, which was sheltered by the former Afghan Taliban regime.
Washington now wants to end its military involvement and has been talking to the Afghan Taliban since at least 2018.
Trump says that troops will only be reduced when the Afghan Taliban give a guarantee that its territory will not be used by Al Qaeda or other international militant groups.
Trump underlined that there was to be no complete withdrawal, keeping a force that would provide “high intelligence”.
“You have to keep a presence,” he said.

India’s GDP growth slows to 5.0%,"
NEW DELHI: India’s economy expanded at its weakest pace in more than six years in April-June, as consumer demand and private investment slowed at a time when global trade frictions have dampened business sentiment.
Asia’s third-largest economy grew at a slower-than-expected 5.0% in the latest three-month period, compared with 5.8% in the previous quarter, government data showed on Friday.
For the same three months, China reported annual economic growth of 6.2%.

 A Reuters poll of economists had forecast annual gross domestic product growth of 5.7% for the latest quarter. In the same period of 2018, India’s growth was 8%.
Analysts expect India’s economic slowdown could continue for the next two three years as the economy faces serious structural issues, hurting consumer demand and manufacturing.
“The government needs to address structural and cyclical issues to address the economic slowdown,” said Devindra Pant, chief economist of India Ratings, an arm of Fitch Ratings, citing a slowdown in the sales of autos and construction and a dip in consumer demand.
The growth numbers could prompt the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy committee to cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points in October. So far this year, it has cut the benchmark repo rate by 110 basis points.
The central bank has shown willingness to join hands with the government to try to revive consumer demand and investments because inflation remains below its 4% medium-term target for a year.
In its annual report, the RBI said on Thursday that reviving consumption demand and private investment – the highest priority – would need a big push for spending on infrastructure and adoption of structural reforms, including labor laws, taxation, and legal reforms, to ease the path for business in India.

Saudi Aramco board sees too many risks for New York IPO,"
DUBAI/LONDON/RIYADH: The board of Saudi Aramco has determined that listing the state energy giant in New York would carry too many legal risks to make it a realistic option, five sources said, although they said a final decision lay with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince.
New York was the exchange favored by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before plans for the initial public offering were put on hold last year, the sources said, even after Aramco’s lawyers and some government advisers had raised legal concerns.
New York offers the largest investor base in the world, vital for an IPO that aims to attract as much as $100 billion, a sum that could prove tough for other exchanges to raise. U.S. President Donald Trump urged the kingdom to list in New York.

 One source familiar with the IPO plan told Reuters the board, made up of cabinet ministers and Aramco executives, had concluded at an August meeting that a U.S. listing would not be considered “unless Aramco is offered sovereign immunity that protects it from any legal action.”
“This is, of course, hard if not impossible to achieve,” the source added.
Like other sources who spoke to Reuters, he asked not to be named because of sensitivities surrounding the fate of the IPO which the crown prince hopes will value the company at $2 trillion. Some insiders and bankers say that figure is too high.
The move to rule out New York and scale back on the valuation suggests technocrats in Aramco and the government are pushing for a more realistic IPO plan, the sources said.
Alongside New York, exchanges in London, Hong Kong and Tokyo have been keen to woo Saudi officials to secure a deal to trade shares in Aramco, which is expected to have a primary listing in Riyadh.
But Saudi officials say the New York disclosure process and complex regulations might legally interfere with the sovereignty of the Saudi government, which would remain the major Aramco shareholder, probably retaining a 95% stake.
“Listing in New York is no longer an option,” one industry source familiar with the IPO process said.
Riyadh and London were now the main options, with the domestic listing first to be followed by an international offering at a later stage, four of the sources said.
“The likelihood of a local listing is increasing, with 1-2% of Aramco being listed locally,” another source familiar with the IPO process said, adding that “the other possibility is listing in London”.
LITIGATION RISKS
Three sources said potential litigation risks in the United States included U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) and proposed U.S. legislation known as “NOPEC”, which could lead to Aramco being sued in U.S. courts.
“The whole system is highly litigious, but of course Aramco has lots of investments in the U.S. which will continue,” said another industry source, who has discussed the IPO process with Saudi officials.
NOPEC legislation would make it illegal for foreign nations to work together to limit fossil fuel supplies and set prices, opening Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to U.S. legal challenges.
JASTA allows lawsuits against the Saudi government as it says it helped plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and should pay compensation. Riyadh denies the charges.
Aramco could also become embroiled in existing lawsuits against oil companies in the United States for their role in climate change, the sources said.
Saudi Aramco said in a statement it “continues to engage with the shareholder on IPO readiness activities”, when asked by Reuters if New York had been dropped as a listing venue.
“The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholder’s choosing,” it added, without elaborating.
Tadawul, the main Saudi stock exchange, has said it expected inflows of $15 billion to $20 billion this year after its inclusion in the FTSE Russell and MSCI emerging market indices, helping secure liquidity for Aramco’s local listing.
The crown prince has favored a New York Stock Exchange listing in part because of Riyadh’s longstanding ties with Washington, sources familiar with Saudi thinking have said. Aramco began life in the 1930s as a U.S.-Saudi venture.
Selling a 5% stake in Aramco has been a centerpiece of Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil. But the IPO, initially slated for 2017, has faced repeated delays.
The IPO is now not expected until Aramco completes its acquisition of a majority stake in petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), pushing it back to 2020 or 2021.
Aramco has already asked major banks to submit proposals for potential roles in the planned IPO, two sources said.
Saudi banks were pitching for various roles in the IPO in late August in the eastern Saudi city of Dhahran, while international banks would be pitching for mandates for the share sale in early September in London, one of the two sources said.

Boeing aims to strengthen engineering oversight after panel review,"
EVERETT: Boeing Co needs to reorganize its engineering reporting lines company-wide and ensure higher-ranking officials, including its CEO, get faster feedback about potential safety concerns from lower levels of the company, according to an internal review at the U.S. planemaker following two recent fatal crashes.
The initial recommendations, presented to Boeing’s board of directors over the weekend, also include potentially creating a new permanent committee to review Boeing’s aircraft design and development, company officials told Reuters.
The new initiatives come from a special board panel set up to review how Boeing develops and builds aircraft after the two crashes. They are intended to boost the transparency of engineering decisions and accelerate efforts to share safety information as widely and swiftly as possible across Boeing’s global businesses and factories.

 Speaking to Reuters at an internal Safety Promotion Center at its manufacturing hub north of Seattle, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg vowed to learn from the crashes as part of what he described as Boeing’s role “to preserve and improve” the safety of global aviation over time.
“Our job is to make sure accidents don’t happen,” Muilenburg said. “Whatever the cause is, we are going to learn, we are going to understand and we are going to make improvements.”
“Ultimately, what we learn from the crashes will be reflected here as well,” Muilenburg added, referring to the hall of exhibits that highlight how some accidents have had an impact on the ways planes are designed and operated. Safety experts say this is part of a wider organised learning process credited with a sharp improvement in safety over the decades.
A new addition to the centre is a roughly six-foot wall of glass with water running over its face that bears the words, “remembering those whose lives were lost in flight,” along with the exact times of the crashes of Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, and a tally of the dead.
The committee’s recommendations are the first structural shifts as part of the company’s response to the ongoing crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX after deadly accidents killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia. The changes will be rolled out over the next couple of months, pending further review and modifications, he said.
Changes within the company could also be informed by the outcome of crash investigations into both accidents, according to a Boeing spokesman.
Muilenburg now receives granular weekly reports of potential safety issues discussed at meetings of rank-and-file engineers – something that did not happen in the past. Those engineers, numbering in the thousands, will report to chief engineers as opposed to being allocated to separate programs – a change designed to help them reach senior Boeing officials more effectively, though their specific jobs will not change.
GLOBAL SCRUTINY
The proposed changes are designed to give greater line-of-sight from the company’s top management into the heart of its industrial programs.
Engineers currently meet to flag and debate potential safety issues on a weekly basis, known internally as safety review boards. The committee recommended “elevating” the meetings to higher raking officials including Muilenburg to add more “transparency and visibility,” he said. “I’m now getting weekly reports that are very valuable.”
The board’s review is just one of numerous probes into the development of the 737 MAX by global regulators and U.S. lawmakers and the Department of Justice. Boeing also faces more than 100 lawsuits by victims’ families alleging it designed a flawed airplane and other issues.
Boeing has apologised for the lives lost and is upgrading critical flight control software at the centre of both crashes. But it has stopped short of admitting any faults in how it developed the 737 MAX, or the software, which repeatedly pushed the plane’s nose down while the pilots struggled to intervene.
“We have been very thorough in looking at every step of the design process, certification process, going all the way back to the original requirements,” Muilenburg said. “We feel very confident in how that was done. But that doesn’t mean we stop learning.”
No employee has been fired over the development of the 737 MAX, he said.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Engineer John Hamilton told Reuters that Boeing and European rival Airbus SE meet several times a year to share data on safety.
“The next time we get together, I am sure we will be sharing learnings from the MAX accidents,” Hamilton said.

France to begin one-month no deal Brexit dress rehearsal,"
PARIS: France will test run measures it has prepared for Britain’s exit from Europe for a month so that companies are fully-prepared ahead of Britain leaving the bloc at the end of October, its minister in charge of customs said on Friday.
Gerald Darmanin will meet Michael Gove, the British minister in charge of coordinating ‘no-deal’ Brexit planning, in Calais later on Friday to show how France is preparing for Britain’s departure from the EU on Oct. 31.
Businesses have been warning of long tailbacks for lorries transporting goods between mainland Europe and Britain, and the British government has said most goods from the EU will be allowed into Britain without full customs checks for at least three months if there is a no deal Brexit.

 “For a month we will act as if there is Brexit for a large number of companies. We’re going to put in place a sort of general rehearsal so that we are ready at the end of October,” Darmanin told RTL radio.
Some 700 extra customs officers have been drafted in and authorities will also introduce online border declarations forcing companies to announce their goods prior to arriving at the border.
“You are in Grenoble (eastern France), you are an a small or medium-sized company, you export to Britain and so you now declare everything online,” Darmanin said.
“There will be barcodes and numbered plates or merchandise … and without stopping at the border, your goods will go directly to Britain. There will be no queues of tens and tens of kilometers.”
France is the EU’s biggest agricultural producer and exports large amounts of wine, spirits and dairy products to Britain, while relying on its neighbour’s waters to sustain its fishing industry.

S&P affirms stable outlook of Pakistan’s economy,"
ISLAMABAD: The Standard & Poor’s credit rating agency has affirmed stable outlook of Pakistan’s economy.
The rating agency also affirmed ‘B-’ long-term and ‘B’ short-term sovereign rating while maintaining the long-term outlook at stable rating.
The government’s securing of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) reform and funding programme, along with considerable additional bilateral and multilateral funding, will help to address near-term funding risks. The rating agency urged for continued reform progress necessary to address Pakistan’s credit vulnerabilities.

 The S&P said its stable outlook reflected its expectations that funding from the IMF and other partners will be sufficient for Pakistan to meet its considerable external obligations over the next one to two years.
The New York-based rating agency said that Pakistan’s rating remained constrained by a narrow tax base and domestic and external risks, which continue to be high.
It forecast Pakistan’s economy to slow down to 2.4 per cent of the GDP during the current fiscal year, which is 12-year low. Taken together with the country’s relatively fast population growth of approximately 2pc per year, real per capita economic growth will fall to 0.4pc.
That will contribute to a decline in the country’s 10-year weighted average per capita growth to 1.8pc, below the global average of 2.3pc for economies at a similar level of income, noted the S&P releases issued on Thursday.
The agency forecast GDP per capita to fall to above $1,200 by the end of this fiscal year, versus $1,565 in fiscal 2017-2018 owing to over 25pc exchange rate loss.

"With racing and music events, Tesla gets over marketing allergy","
SHANGHAI/SAN FRANCISCO: Tesla has always shown disdain for marketing, with CEO Elon Musk boasting his company does not advertise, instead using the money it would have spent to develop products.
But in China, the world’s biggest electric vehicle market where Tesla is gearing up for a major sales push, that tune has started to change as the automaker promotes racing events, showroom parties with DJs and a line of Chinese Tesla stickers for chat apps.
Case in point: Wang Yubo, a 30-year-old marketing executive and Tesla car owner, was invited by the company to burnish his driving skills at a Shanghai racing track this month.

 “I learned how to push my Model 3 to its limits,” said Wang, who writes both enthusiastic and critical blogs about Tesla and occasionally races his car with friends.
Tesla is expanding its focus beyond products to service, says Leo Liu, head of the company’s China driving school which aims to teach people “to make full use of their cars”.
It held three such events for auto reporters, social media influencers and a handful of owners in August – one in Beijing and two in Shanghai and plans to expand to other big cities such as Guangzhou and Chengdu.
“We are also thinking of having more difficult ones on ice tracks in winter this year,” Liu said, adding that more owners will be invited in the future.
While Tesla hasn’t embarked on conventional TV or billboard advertising, the U.S. firm’s China Chief Tom Zhu has been working on strategies this year to boost the brand’s appeal, frequently seeking ideas and opinions from marketing and sales experts, sources familiar with the discussions said.
The sources were not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified. Tesla declined to comment.
BIG FACTORY, BIG PLANS
Helping raise his profile in China, Musk is currently visiting the country and on Thursday held a discussion with Alibaba’s Jack Ma at an AI industry event, although they avoided controversial issues like the U.S.-China trade war.
Tesla’s new efforts to reach customers in China come as the Silicon Valley automaker is preparing to open a big vehicle assembly factory in Shanghai and confront fierce competition in the luxury electric vehicle market it invented.
The firm’s first overseas factory is due to start production by the end of the year and Tesla has said it should be able to build 3,000 Model 3 vehicles a week in its initial phases.
That would translate to nearly four times the number of imported Model 3 vehicles sold in China per month this year, according to figures from research firm LMC Automotive.
The plant is slated to have annual output capacity of 250,000 vehicles after production of the Model Y is added.
“We have to learn how to manage a larger sales and after-sales system as production is growing to a completely different level,” said one source. “That’s why we are doing these events now.”
The sources added, however, that Tesla is spending far less than what a conventional carmaker in China would be spending on marketing.
In Tesla’s favour, it has been exporting cars to China since 2014 and remains the benchmark that other automakers in China often compare their electric vehicles to when they advertise.
The launch of the Model 3 for the Chinese market in late February has also gone well, sending Tesla’s China revenue jumping 42% to $1.5 billion in the first half – equivalent to 13.5% of total revenue.
But Tesla in China doesn’t have the headstart in all-electric vehicles that it had in the U.S. market when it debuted the Model S in 2012.
Chinese startup Nio Inc sells two premium all-electric SUVs, Jaguar has launched is I-PACE SUV and BMW has its i3 hatchback and i8 sportscar. By the end of the year, Audi will have two all-electric SUVs on the market while Daimler’s Mercedes will have one.
The U.S firm also doesn’t expect Musk’s cult status to propel sales to the same extent it does elsewhere, the sources said.
Most Chinese do not have easy access to his Twitter feed followed by nearly 28 million, although Tesla translates some of his less controversial tweets on its Weibo account.
In addition to chat app stickers that express various emotions – a market strategy also used by other automakers – Tesla is partnering with Tencent’s QQ Music streaming service in organising parties with DJs at showrooms.
Both marketing tactics are China-only developments, the sources said.
Social media users have noticed much more activity on Tesla’s Weibo account in recent months while company has also held several roundtables with reporters and internet influencers throughout China since July.

Google reveals years-long ‘indiscriminate’ iPhone hack,"
Google security experts uncovered an “indiscriminate” hacking operation that targeted iPhones over a period of at least two years and used websites to implant malicious software to access photos, user locations and other data.
In a post Thursday on the blog of Google’s Project Zero security taskforce, cyber experts did not name the hacked websites hosting the attacks, but estimated they received thousands of visitors a week.
“Simply visiting the hacked site was enough for the exploit server to attack your device, and if it was successful, install a monitoring implant,” said Project Zero’s Ian Beer.

 Once installed, the malicious software “primarily focused on stealing files and uploading live location data,” Beer said, adding it had been able to access encrypted messenger apps like Telegram, WhatsApp and iMessage.
Google hangouts and Gmail had also been affected, he added in the post, which provided a detailed breakdown of how the malicious software targeted and exploited iPhone vulnerabilities.
Most of the vulnerabilities targeted were found in the iPhone’s default Safari web browser, Beer said, adding that the Project Zero team had discovered them in almost every operating system from iOS 10 through to the current iOS 12 version.
Once embedded in a user’s iPhone, the malicious software sent back stolen data, including live user location data back to a “command and control server” every 60 seconds.
Beer said Google had informed Apple of the attacks in February, and Apple subsequently released a security patch for the iOS 12.1.
Long the driver of Apple’s money-making machine, iPhone revenue overall was down 12 percent from last year to $26 billion.
The tech giant sent out invitations on Thursday to a September event at its Silicon Valley campus where it is expected to unveil a new-generation iPhone.

Huawei plans high-end phone launch under cloud of Google ban,"
NEW YORK/FRANKFURT: Huawei Technologies plans to forge ahead with the launch of new high-end smartphones in Europe even though it may not be able to offer Google’s official Android operating system and widely used apps such as Google Maps, company executives told Reuters.
The world’s No. 2 smartphone maker is set to unveil its new Mate 30 line of phones on Sept. 18 in Munich, according to a source familiar with the matter, though it is not clear when the devices would go on sale.
The Mate 30, made to work on new 5G mobile networks, is Huawei’s first major flagship smartphone launch since U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration effectively blacklisted the company in mid-May, alleging it is involved in activities that compromise U.S. national security, a charge the company denies.

 A Google spokesman told Reuters the Mate 30 cannot be sold with licensed Google apps and services due to the U.S. ban on sales to Huawei. A temporary reprieve that the U.S. government announced last week does not apply to new products such as the Mate 30, the spokesman said.
U.S. companies can seek a license for specific products to be exempted from the ban. Google, a part of Alphabet Inc, would not say whether it had applied for a license to offer its apps and services known as Google Mobile Services, though it has said in the past that it wants to continue supplying Huawei.
Reuters reported this week that the U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to Huawei, but none have been granted.
The uncertainty surrounding the Mate 30 shows the confusion that reigns for Huawei and its business partners as a result of the escalating trade war between China and the United States. While the Huawei blacklisting was cast as a response to security concerns, President Trump has indicated it could be lifted as part of a trade deal.
“Huawei will continue to use the Android OS and ecosystem if the U.S. government allows us to do so,” Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly told Reuters. “Otherwise, we will continue to develop our own operating system and ecosystem.”
The Commerce Department declined to comment.
NO GOOGLE, NO SALES?
Huawei can likely use an open-source version of Android without falling foul of the U.S. ban on sales to them. But Google’s apps can only be used in Europe under a paid license from the search giant. There is no fee for the license outside of Europe.
“Without Google Services, no one will buy the device,” said independent analyst Richard Windsor. The Google software normally comes pre-loaded on Android devices.
Huawei earlier this month announced its own mobile operating system, dubbed Harmony. But analysts and Huawei executives are skeptical that it is yet a viable alternative to Android.
Huawei vaulted quickly into the top ranks of the global smartphone business in recent years with highly regarded hardware, and Europe has been a key market.
But the U.S. ban has dealt a body blow to sales outside of China, with Huawei’s market share in Europe sliding to 19.3% in the second quarter from 24.9% in the first, figures from Counterpoint Research show.
As late as last week, senior Huawei executives struck a confident tone regarding Android and Google.
“Our new phones will still be based on Android,” Vincent Pang, senior vice president and board director of Huawei, told a media gathering at the top of New York City’s One World Trade Center, an iconic American symbol of perseverance.
“We want to maintain one standard, one ecosystem, one technology,” he said.

Apple to supply parts to independent repair shops for first time,"
Apple said on Thursday it will begin selling parts, tools and repair guides to independent shops to fix broken iPhones, a major change after years of lobbying against laws in some U.S. states that would have compelled it to do just that.
Apple said the program, which should help ease heavy demand on Apple and its authorized partners to fix millions of cracked screens and fried charging ports, will launch in the United States before being rolled out to other countries.
The back flip means that independent repair shops will be offered official parts for out-of-warranty repairs at the same price offered to authorized service providers, such as Best Buy Inc (BBY.N), which perform warranty work.

 Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said the move could create more opportunities for Apple to sell services or accessories if it encourages iPhone owners to hand down used phones to friends and family.
“That helps them get the product more affordably into the hands of more customers and increases the base,” Bajarin said. “Every data point seems to say, if you get someone into the Apple ecosystem, they generally don’t leave.”
Apple’s iPhone sales have declined in the past two fiscal quarters, but sales of accessories such as its AirPods wireless headphones and the Apple Watch, along with paid services like Apple Music, have helped make up for some of the revenue falls.
Independent shops have long complained that the high purchase volumes required by Apple to become an authorized service provider priced them out of the repair market.
The tech giant had previously lobbied against “right-to-repair” bills to supply independent businesses in several U.S. states, including New York and California, citing concerns about maintaining a high service standard. It earlier this year allowed all U.S. Best Buy stores to handle warranty work.
However, the unofficial repair industry that sprang up, using mostly aftermarket parts supplied by third parties, was often unreliable.
Apple said it trialed the new repair program for a year with 20 businesses across North America, Europe and Asia. It did not give a timetable for the international launches.
The program will allow independent stores to set their own prices for repairs and also offer cheaper aftermarket parts. They will be required to return any collected broken Apple parts to the company for refurbishment or recycling.
The program will be free for shops to join, but they will be required to have an Apple-certified technician who has taken a free 40-hour training course and test provided by the company.

Apple’s data shows a deepening dependence on China as Trump’s tariffs loom,"
Tapping factories in Brazil and India has not lessened Apple Inc’s dependence on China, the company’s supply chain data shows, raising the stakes for the iPhone maker as United States President Donald Trump wages a trade war and promises more tariffs.
Apple faces levies of 15 per cent imposed by Trump’s administration on major products made in China such as smartwatches and wireless headphones on September 1, with a tariff on itsbiggest seller, the iPhone, to take effect on December 15.
Few American firms are as tightly bound to Asia’s largest economy as Apple. Contract factories owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd’s Foxconn, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and others employ hundreds of thousands of workers to assemble Apple devices.

 In recent years, Apple’s contract manufacturers have expanded into other countries. India, for example, had no Apple contract manufacturer locations in 2015 but expanded to three assembly facilities by 2019, including a factory owned by Foxconn, which plans to make models from the iPhone X family of devices,Reutersreportedlast year.
Apple taps the India operations to avoid steep import duties on iPhones in one of the last fast-growing mobile phone markets on the planet, similar to Apple and Foxconn’s move to open a production facility in Brazil in 2011. But the factories outside China are smaller and, in the case of India and Brazil, Apple only uses them to meet domestic demand. Apple’s contract factories inside China, meanwhile, have added far more locations than outside, with Foxconn alone expanding from 19 locations in 2015 to 29 in 2019 and Pegatron going from eight to 12, according to Apple’s data.
The new locations come as Apple has added watches, smart speakers and wireless headphones to its product lineup. And beyond the contract factories, the rest of Apple’s suppliers — the companies that sell it chips, glass, aluminium casings, cables, circuit boards and much more — became more concentrated in China.
Among all supplier locations, 44.9pc were in China in 2015, a proportion that rose to 47.6pc by 2019, the data showed.Reutersanalysed five years’ worth of supply chain data published by Apple. The data includes more than 750 locations each year between 2015 and 2019 for the California company’s top 200 suppliers based on Apple’s spending.
Apple does not disclose how much it spends with each, and the companies on the list can change as different suppliers make the top-200 cutoff among Apple’s thousands of suppliers.
Reuterssorted the data and calculated the overall portion of Apple’s supply chain in China. In a few cases each year, Apple did not provide a specific address andReutersexcluded that location. Apple declined to comment on Reuters’ analysis.
In July, Chief Executive Tim Cook told investors on the company’s quarterly earnings call that he “wouldn’t put a lot of stock into” speculation about how the company would shift production because of US tariffs.
“The vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere,” Cook said on the call. “There is a significant level of content in the United States, and a lot from Japan to Korea to China, and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. […] I think that will carry the day in the future as well.”
No place like China
Apple faces hurdles in diversifying beyond China, where the clustering of multiple suppliers allows it to make hundreds of millions of devices per year while holding only a few days’ worth of inventory, which is critical to the free cash flow Apple investors prize.
Other phone makers ship far fewer units and have more flexibility. Alphabet Inc’s Google is shifting its Pixel smartphone production to Vietnam from China starting this year as it builds a cheap supply chain in Southeast Asia, the Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday.
But Apple’s scale works against it because few other nations have workforces as large as China. Factories require highly skilled engineers to design and troubleshoot custom tools and processes. Vietnam, where Apple has manufactured accessories for years, has a population less than one-tenth the size of China.
Even if Apple can make devices in India or Vietnam, the volumes would be small compared with Apple’s overall needs. Outside of China, “there few places in the world that have the infrastructure to produce 600,000 phones a day”, said Dave Evans, chief executive of San Francisco supply chain firm Fictiv.
Apple has so far been spared tariffs on major products, winning a reprieve last year on many wireless devices. And Cook has cultivated a close relationship with Trump over dinners and private meetings at the White House. Apple has told trade officials that it generally believes tariffs will result in higher prices for US consumers but has not said whether it plans to pass tariffs onto customers by raising prices.
For electronics products, where the circuit board is made can sometimes determine the product’s country of origin, said George R. Tuttle III, a customs attorney who has worked with electronics firms. That leaves open the possibility that device makers could make circuit boards or other key components outside China while still assembling devices there to avoid tariffs. Apple has disclosed no such plans.
But the India unit of Foxconn, which also performs work for HMD Global’s Nokia-branded phones and Xiaomi Corp in addition to Apple, has developed the ability to make circuit boards in India, two industry sources toldReuterslast year.
Year Percentage of Apple supplier locations in China:

2015: 44.9pc
2016: 45.1pc
2017: 46.0pc
2018: 47.6pc

Facebook acknowledges flaw in Messenger Kids app,"
Facebook acknowledged a flaw in its Messenger Kids app, weeks after two U.S. senators raised privacy concerns about the application, and said that it spoke to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about the matter.
“We are in regular contact with the FTC on many issues and products, including Messenger Kids,” Facebook Vice President Kevin Martin wrote in a letter to two Democrats, which is seen by Reuters. He described the flaw as a “technical error”.
The letter dated Aug. 27 was sent to Democratic Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.

 “Based on our review, we have determined that the technical error you have inquired above arose in October 2018. The fix we implemented is designed to prevent the issue from happening again,” Facebook said in the letter.
The senators said on Wednesday they were disappointed by Facebook’s approach on the matter.
“We are particularly disappointed that Facebook did not commit to undertaking a comprehensive review of Messenger Kids to identify additional bugs or privacy issues,” Markey and Blumenthal said in response to Facebook’s letter.
The senators had written to Facebook on Aug. 6 questioning whether there was a “worrying pattern” of poor privacy protection for children using the Messenger Kids app and sought transparency.
The senators were “disturbed” to learn that the application allowed thousands of children to join group chats in which not all members of the group were approved by their parents, they said in the letter to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.
In July, Facebook agreed to pay a record $5 billion fine to resolve an FTC probe into its privacy practices and will boost safeguards on user data.
FTC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular business hours.

16-year-old climate campaigner completes 15-day journey across the Atlantic,"
Teenage climate campaigner Greta Thunberg said the “war on nature must end” and called on Donald Trump to listen to science after she sailed into New York on a zero-emissions yacht on Wednesday.
The 16-year-old completed a 15-day journey across the Atlantic shortly after 4:00 pm (2000 GMT), stepping off the boat onto a Manhattan dock to cheering crowds chanting her name.
“It is devastating and so horrible. It’s hard to imagine. They are a clear sign that we need to stop destroying nature,” she told waiting reporters when asked how she felt about raging fires in the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest.

 The Swede also rebuked Trump, a notorious climate change skeptic.
“My message for him is listen to the science and he obviously doesn’t do that,” she said, as she brought her environmental message to the United States for the first time.
Thunberg poked fun at the president too by saying she was “pretty sure” windmills don’t cause cancer, in reference to a comment Trump made at a Republican fundraising event in April.
The teenager has become a symbol for climate action with her stark warnings of catastrophe if the world does not act now to cut carbon emissions and curb global warming.
Thunberg, who was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome at the age of 12, began sitting outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to get members to act on climate change.
She was quickly joined by other students around the world, as word of her strike spread through the media, and the “Fridays for future” movement was born.
She will attend a summit on zero emissions at the United Nations next month but refused to fly because of the carbon emissions caused by planes.
The Swede was offered a ride on the Malizia II racing yacht skippered by Pierre Casiraghi, the son of Monaco’s Princess Caroline, and German round-the-world sailor Boris Herrmann.
Thunberg has received criticism and abuse for her uncompromising attitude, however.
‘Insane’
Her voyage sparked controversy after a spokesman for co-skipper Herrmann told Berlin newspaper TAZ that several people would fly into New York to help take the yacht back to Europe.
Hermann himself will also return by plane, according to the spokesman.
Team Malizia’s manager insisted, though, that the young activist’s journey would be climate neutral, as the flights would “be offset.” A few hundred well-wishers and activists clapped and chanted “Greta, Greta, Greta” as she completed her 3,000-nautical-mile (5,550 kilometers) trip under overcast skies.
She passed the Statue of Liberty and headed up the Hudson River before docking at North Cove Marina near the World Trade Center.
The United Nations sent a flotilla of 17 sailboats, one for each of its sustainable development goals for 2030, to welcome her.
Thunberg endured rough seas and cramped conditions but said she never felt seasick once. She ate freeze-dried food and used a bucket as a toilet.
“It’s insane that a 16-year-old has to cross the Atlantic Ocean to make a stand. This, of course, is not something that I want everyone to do,” she said, smiling.
Thunberg added that she planned to rest before joining youngsters striking outside the UN on Friday.
The Malizia II yacht left Plymouth in southern England on August 14, and the teenager marked the first anniversary of the start of her school strike on August 20.
The 18-meter yacht features state-of-the-art solar panels on its deck and sides, and two hydro-generators provide the vessel’s electricity.
It can travel at speeds of around 35 knots (70 kilometres an hour).
Thunberg has said that she does not yet know how she will return to Europe.
Ahead of the UN summit on September 23, Thunberg will take part in youth demonstrations, before heading to Canada, Mexico and then to Chile for another UN conference in December.

Climate activists to fly drones at London Heathrow airport,"
LONDON: British climate-change activists said they would fly toy drones at London’s Heathrow airport from September 13, a step that is likely to ground all flights, to put pressure on the government to take tougher steps to reduce greenhouse gases.
The “Heathrow Pause” group said it would fly toy drones within the restricted zone but outside the flight paths of the airport, a step the group said would force the airport to ground flights.
“This is a symbolic action, using a legal loophole and participants’ self-sacrifice to draw attention to the most serious and urgent crisis humanity has ever faced,” the group said.

 “The government’s inaction on climate change, and the looming catastrophe of airport expansion, gives us no choice, and compels us to act,” the group said.
Heathrow is Europe’s largest airport.
A spokeswoman for Heathrow declined immediate comment.
Heathrow Pause said it would fly drones at no higher than head level and give the airport one hour’s advance notice.

Huawei wants to build first fiber-optic cable between South America and Asia,"
SANTIAGO: Huawei Technologies said on Wednesday it was “very actively” interested in building the first undersea fiber-optic cable between South America and Asia.
David Dou Yong, Huawei’s chief executive in Chile, told Reuters the company was eagerly following the public tender process initiated by Chile in July and would participate when bids were invited for the trans-Pacific construction.
“Huawei will be very actively participating in this business opportunity,” he said in an interview.

 “This bidding process has several steps … We are ready and we will follow the process until the bid to select a vendor to implement it starts and for sure we will be part of the tender process.”
His comments came two months after another Chinese telecoms firm, Hengtong Optic-Electric Co Ltd, said in a filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange that it had signed a letter of intent with Huawei to buy its 51% stake in Huawei Marine Systems, the company’s submarine cable business, via cash and share issuance.
The move would represent Huawei’s first major asset sale since the United States ratcheted up accusations the Chinese firm is a vehicle for espionage, raising doubts about undersea cable construction projects Huawei has interests in around the world.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration effectively blacklisted Huawei in mid-May, alleging it was involved in activities that compromise U.S. national security, a charge the company has denied.
Asked for clarification about the reported sale of the submarine cable business and its implications, the company’s head of public affairs Weiqiang Zou said the deal was not confirmed.
“This is something that came out a few months ago but it is not confirmed and there is no final decision,” he said.
On Wednesday Huawei launched a data center with locally-hosted cloud storage services in Santiago, an investment of more than $100 million.
Huawei has lobbied the Chilean government to store its data in the cloud.
Documents reviewed by Reuters show that in the past three years, senior Huawei executives have held dozens of meetings with city mayors and government ministers and officials from the Chilean police, its central bank, its tax authority, its army, the state development agency and the ministries of mining, health, economy, transport, energy and interior to lobby for cloud computing and facial recognition software technology.

French researcher hacks into Moscow’s new e-voting system,"
STRASBOURG: A French researcher has exposed a security breach in an electronic voting system to be used in next month’s municipal elections in Moscow, potentially giving hackers access to voters’ choices.
The University of Lorraine and France’s CNRS research institute said this week the cryptographer had taken up a challenge set by Echo of Moscow radio to test the system being rolled out for the vote.
“Less than a month before Moscow tries online voting for electing the city’s new parliament, a French cryptographer has just exposed a security breach for the protocol being tested,” the two institutions said in a statement.

 The researcher, Pierrick Gaudry, was able to crack into the source code being published daily as part of a public test since late July.
Gaudry needed only 20 minutes to break the encryption code, or “private key”, that is supposed to protect voters’ identities and choices. He used a standard computer and widely available free software.
“According to him, a hacker would have been able to get this private key in just 10 minutes,” they said.
“In the worst-case scenario, the votes of all the voters using this system would be revealed to anyone as soon as they cast their vote,” Gaudry wrote of his findings in a research paper posted online.
Since mid-July, Moscow has seen a wave of rallies drawing tens of thousands onto the streets after opposition figures were barred from standing in the elections to Moscow’s city parliament on September 8.
The online voting system, available through the City Hall website, requires passport information, home address and other sensitive information, and uses text message verification.
Officials say the system testing won’t be complete until next week, just days ahead of the election.
Since the publication of Gaudry’s paper on August 14, Moscow authorities have said the encryption code has been made more complex, and will be divided into seven distinct parts kept separate until voting ends.
The editor-in-chief of Echo of Moscow, Alexey Venediktov, announced on his Telegram channel Tuesday that he had given Gaudry a prize of one million rubles ($15,000). Other awards would be offered to anyone else who exposed breaches in the system.

Taylor Swift’s ‘Lover’ album breaks new record,"
U.S. singer-songwriter Taylor Swift’s album “Lover” broke a new record for an international artist in China on Friday as it surpassed one million combined total streams, downloads and sales within a week of its release.
The combined total makes it China’s most-consumed full-length international album ever in such a short space of time.
“Lover” was released on August 23 and is expected to reach 825,000-850,000 equivalent album sales in its first week in the United States, according to Billboard magazine.

 The record includes songs “ME!” featuring Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco, and “You Need to Calm Down”, which has a music video starring a plethora of celebrities and LGBTQ stars including Katy Perry, Laverne Cox, Ellen Degeneres, and Adam Rippon.
The music video for the title track “Lover” was released last week and is set in a doll-house-like series of vignettes, moving from room to room as Swift plays instruments including drums, a violin and a guitar.
Swift’s previous albums “1989” and “Reputation” both surpassed one million consumptions in China, but over a longer period of time.

Darth Vader helmet among Hollywood treasures in $10 million auction,"
LOS ANGELES: Darth Vader’s helmet from The Empire Strikes Backis among a vast collection of coveted Hollywood treasures going under the hammer next month, with experts predicting it could fetch nearly $500,000.
The mask and helmet is one of only a handful worn by actor David Prowse, who played Luke Skywalker’s nemesis and — spoiler alert — father on-screen in the 1980 Star Warsblockbuster, making them the “holy grail” of science fiction artifacts, according to auction organizers.
“The catalog estimate is $250,000-$450,000, and you never know what something will go for until it crosses the block — it could well exceed that,” said Zach Pogemiller of auctioneer Profiles in History.

 “Star Wars is always popular. It’s never been hotter than it is right now, with the franchise continuing as strongly as it is.”
The “Icons and Legends of Hollywood” sale will take place September 25-26 in Los Angeles, with nearly 1,000 lots together expected to sell for over $10 million.
It will feature items from some of Tinseltown’s most iconic movies, ranging from Hollywood’s golden age to contemporary action movies and sci-fi.
Up for grabs will be a black-and-white dress worn by Dorothy — or more specifically, Judy Garland’s camera double Barbara Koshay — in 1939 classic “The Wizard Of Oz,” which is estimated to reach up to $500,000.
A prototype moon buggy stolen by James Bond from villain Blofeld’s secret lair in “Diamonds Are Forever” will also go under the hammer, with an upper estimate of $600,000.
Among additional items expected to trigger bidding frenzies are a dress worn by Rose (Kate Winslet) in Titanic, the DeLorean car smashed by a train in Back to the Future III, and an authentic best picture Oscar statuette from 1948.
“You always hear stories of movie studio personnel who rescued what are now priceless pieces from the dumpster because they were being thrown out,” said Pogemiller.
“It’s incredible that people really didn’t have the foresight until relatively recently to preserve all of these important artifacts that are part of our cultural history.”

Scarlett Johansson tackles painful divorce tale in ‘fated’ drama ‘Marriage Story’,"
VENICE, Italy: Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play a couple in crisis in Marriage Story, an emotional tale of a relationship falling apart and a project the Hollywood actress said she felt was ‘fated’ as it came about as she went through her own divorce.
The Avengers regular and Star Wars actor portray actress Nicole and theatre director Charlie, who go their separate ways when the former, feeling unfilled, returns to her native Los Angeles with their son to shoot a television series pilot.
While Charlie at first believes Nicole and Henry, 8, will eventually return to New York, he soon realises this will not happen. The couple want an amicable split but it spirals into something nastier when pushy divorce lawyers are called in.

 The Netflix film, directed and written by Noah Baumbach, has been billed one of the must-sees at the Venice Film Festival, where the streaming giant won the top Golden Lion Prize last year for Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma.
Baumbach, whose last work The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) was also a Netflix film, has spoken of how he drew from his own personal experience of divorce and that of friends when writing the movie.
“Something that I discovered in writing (the film is that) … when something stops working that you actually acknowledge it or recognise it for the first time,” Baumbach told a news conference.
“It’s like if you’re going through a door and it’s locked you suddenly look at the door and you look at how it works, so I thought well through a divorce we could explore a marriage.”
Johansson told reporters she was going through a divorce herself when she first met Baumbach to talk about the film. The 34-year-old was previously married to actor Ryan Reynolds and journalist turned art curator Romain Dauriac.
“I hadn’t seen (Baumbach) in a long time…so I think I just kind of probably blew into the room and you know just ordered a glass of white wine and started complaining,” she said.
“He was just listening and attentive, but then he said ‘funny you should be talking about this, probably either a project you’re really gonna want to do or not want to see or be a part of I don’t know, we’ll see how you feel about it’, but it was almost…it felt sort of fated in a way I guess.”
Viewers follow Nicole and Charlie’s journey to divorce as they try to navigate a new life apart and across the country, both intent on making sure their son is spared the pain of his parents separating.
Tensions eventually rise, climaxing in a huge screaming match, a scene Driver said made him think of “the theatrics of divorce”.
“You’re kind of performing … for a judge and there’s mediators,” he said.
“So in working on it, it just felt more like that, it felt like theatre, we blocked it out, we talked about where we were going to go, it wasn’t something that we winged.”
The movie already had murmurings of potential awards success before its Thursday premiere and critics in Venice were enthusiastic.
The Hollywood Reporter called it “Baumbach’s best yet” and Variety said it was “better than good; it’s more than just accomplished”, while IndieWire praised “a pair of devastating performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson that rank as their very best”.

Michael Mann eyes ‘Heat 2’ film as book nears completion,"
LOS ANGELES: Michael Mann wants to make a big-screen sequel to “Heat,” the iconic movie that brought Hollywood legends Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together for the first time, the director has told AFP.
The sprawling 1995 epic starring Pacino as a Los Angeles detective pursuing De Niro’s heist gang boss across the city is considered a classic crime thriller.
Mann announced in 2016 that a novel inspired by “Heat” would be published by his own HarperCollins publishing imprint — and shared fresh details with AFP.

 “The novel is about two-thirds written, and it’s the prequel to ‘Heat’ and it’s the sequel to ‘Heat’ rolled together,” said Mann. “So it’s everything before the movie and everything after the movie.”
Asked if he plans to give the novel the movie treatment, Mann said: “Of course!” before adding that he could also foresee it evolving into a television series.
“Initially a film, but the landscape is changing so radically and so quickly, who knows?” he said.
Mann said the book would explore the time De Niro’s character Neil McCauley spent in prison in his twenties, as well as the years Pacino’s cop Vincent Hanna worked on the Chicago police force before moving to Los Angeles.
It will also feature the childhood of Val Kilmer’s character, young bank robber Chris Shiherlis.
Mann, 76, is co-writing the book with crime author Reed Coleman, and it is due to be published next year, he said.
The original “Heat,” lauded for its striking neo-noir cinematography, featured a meeting in a diner between the two leads that marked their first scene together after appearing separately in “The Godfather: Part II” 21 years earlier.
Pacino and De Niro will be reunited on the big screen later this year for Martin Scorsese’s gangster film “The Irishman.”

Brad Pitt says ‘Ad Astra’ his ‘most challenging film’,"
VENICE: Brad Pitt has fought in wars, pulled off robbery heists and confronted rivals in the boxing ring during his career, but the Hollywood star says his most challenging film yet is playing an astronaut on a life-saving mission in the space epic “Ad Astra”.
The 55-year-old actor takes audiences to the far reaches of the solar system in his role as Roy McBride after a new threat causing disastrous power surges threatens Earth.
McBride sets off to find his pioneering astronaut father, played by Tommy Lee Jones, who went missing more than a decade earlier while on a mission to Neptune.

 Set in the near future when mankind has set up living stations and research centers on the moon and Mars, McBride makes his way into the vast abyss journeying through spectacular landscapes and empty space.
The trip soon becomes a journey of self-discovery.
“This has been the most challenging film I have ever worked on,” Pitt, also a producer on the movie, told a news conference at the Venice Film Festival, where “Ad Astra” premieres on Thursday.
“The story … is so delicate and any clip of a frame too early or music cue or voiceover could easily tip the thing over or be too much or be too obvious. It was a constant effort just to try to maintain this balance and try to keep this story unfolding in a very subtle and delicate way.”
McBride narrates his history and relationship with his father throughout the odyssey, where he faces challenges as well as enemies in an inhospitable and lonely environment.
“We decided to try and tell the smallest possible story in the biggest possible tapestry… The tiny becomes the universal,” director James Gray said.
“Ad Astra” is one of 21 movies competing for the top Golden Lion prize at the 76th edition of the Venice Film Festival, which runs until Sept. 7.
﻿
DISCOMFORT
Venice is no stranger to screening space movies, having previously premiered the Oscar-winning “Gravity”, starring Pitt’s regular co-star and friend George Clooney, as well as “First Man”, about the 1969 moon landing.
Asked if he had exchanged any space movie tips with Clooney, Pitt referenced the process of hanging from wires during such shoots, saying: “George and I exchanged some discomfort stories.”
The film, which also stars Liv Tyler, Ruth Negga and Donald Sutherland and which has had several release date changes, is considered by movie critics as one of the must-sees during the festival, an important launchpad for the awards season.
Asked whether the role could perhaps win him his first best actor Oscar, Pitt said: “Man I just want to get this film out … it’s a challenging film, it’s subtle.
“It’s operating on many cylinders, it has something to say about who we are, a soul if you believe in that, what’s our purpose, why do we hang on, keep doing. So I am really curious to see how it lands.”

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister’s Focal Person on Polio, Babar Bin Atta, on Friday announced that the latest anti-polio vaccination campaign was successfully concluded in 46 districts across the country, ARY News reported.
The premier’s focal person, in his latest statement here today, detailed that 7.1 million children were administered oral polio vaccine (OPV) during the campaign, whereas, the parents who were against the anti-polio vaccination were persuaded for its administration for the first time.
Atta said that the authorities are carrying out actions against the elements opposing the anti-polio vaccination.

 While elaborating the statistics, he said the concerned authorities have blocked 75 social media accounts which were propagating against the polio vaccines.

"Ebola death toll in east Congo outbreak climbs above 2,000","
GOMA: The death toll from Democratic Republic of Congo’s year-long Ebola outbreak has climbed above 2,000, government data showed on Friday, as responders battle to overcome community mistrust and widespread security problems.
The death in neighboring Uganda of a 9-year-old girl who had tested positive for the virus after entering the country from Congo underscored the challenge medical teams face containing the disease in border territory with a highly mobile population.
The government team overseeing the response said the number of confirmed and probable cases had also hit a milestone of more than 3,000 in what has become the second-worst epidemic of the virus on record.

 Despite the development of an effective vaccine and treatments, health workers have struggled to stop the virus spreading in remote and conflict-hit areas of eastern Congo, where many locals are wary of the response effort.
Nevertheless, the World Health Organization said the latest Uganda case highlighted the border authorities’ skill at detecting and isolating potential sources of transmission.
“This case was picked up at the border,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said at a briefing in Geneva. “The people who are at the borders have the expertise.”
This is Congo’s 10th Ebola outbreak, but it is the first in the densely forested hillside provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, where militia-led violence and ethnic killing have undermined security in certain areas for decades.
The WHO declared the epidemic an international health emergency in July – only the fifth outbreak to warrant this status since the system was introduced in 2005.
The authorities have since come up against new fronts in their fight to contain the virus, testing the reach and flexibility of responders.
Health workers confirmed the first cases in South Kivu province on Aug. 16. Soon after, a woman contracted the virus in a remote, militia-controlled territory in North Kivu, hundreds of kilometers away from other known cases.
“The response is being spread too thin chasing new cases at the expense of the longer-term community engagement that is crucial if we’re ever to hope of being Ebola free,” Oxfam’s Congo Director Corinne N’Daw said in a statement.
Despite the virus spreading to new areas, the past week’s transmission rate was little changed from that of the past month and a half, which has seen an average of 77 new cases per week, according to the WHO.
Last week the WHO voiced concern about the widening geographic reach of the disease, but confirmed the virus had not gained a foothold in the major city of Goma, even after four cases were recorded there in July and early August.
Goma, a lakeside city of nearly 2 million people on the Rwandan border, had been on high alert for weeks after a gold miner with a large family infected several people with Ebola before dying himself.
The latest government data showed Ebola deaths reaching 2,006 and cases at 3,004.
“Two thousand deaths means that there is a problem,” said Timothée Buliga, a priest, returning home from his church in Goma. “We need to reach the point where we reject Ebola, say no and eradicate it definitively.”
Only the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been deadlier than the current outbreak. More than 11,300 people died then out of the 28,000 who were infected.

TOKYO: The GAVI global vaccines alliance on Friday called on donors for $7.4 billion to help immunize 300 million children against life-threatening diseases between 2021 and 2025, and save up to eight million lives.
GAVI, which is backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization (WHO), donor governments and others, funds immunization programs for poor nations that cannot afford to buy vaccines at rich-world prices.
“Over the past two decades the Vaccine Alliance has helped to protect a generation against some of the world’s deadliest diseases,” GAVI CEO Seth Berkley said in a statement.

 “However, 1.5 million people are still dying every year from vaccine-preventable diseases … This calls for an urgent response to ensure people continue to be protected against disease, to prevent deadly outbreaks and to help the next generation prosper.”

E-cigarette promotion: US probing JUUL’s ‘deceptive’ social media marketing,"
WASHINGTON: US regulators are looking into potentially “deceptive marketing” used by popular e-cigarette brand JUUL Labs that targeted teens, according to a news report Thursday.
The company declined to confirm any investigation but in a statement Thursday said it ended the short-lived social media campaign and announced new efforts to keep the vaping product out of the hands of adolescents.
The Federal Trade Commission, which handles consumer product complaints, is investigating the marketing practices and is deciding whether to seek monetary damages, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

 It was another blow to the company hit by a recent way of reports of illness and death linked to e-cigarette use.
It also comes just as Altria, a major shareholder in JUUL, considers a merger with tobacco giant Philip Morris International.
A JUUL spokesperson said the company will always “fully cooperate” with any government agency or regulator, but would not confirm whether an investigation is underway.
“We have never marketed to youth,” the spokesperson said in an email to AFP.
“Our earliest marketing campaign in 2015 was intended for adults in the 25-34 year-old demographic and lasted for six months…. Nonetheless, we regret that the campaign was executed in a way that was perceived as appealing to minors.”
In addition, the use of paid social media “influencers” to promote the product was tried briefly and abandoned last year, and the company has “exited social media entirely,” the official said.
JUUL had used various social media channels to show young adults using the product, and also sold appealing flavors that was associated with an surge in teen vaping.
But the company shut stopped selling the flavored versions in brick-and-mortar stores where teens have easier access to the product.
In a statement on Thursday, the company announced new steps “to combat the issue of youth access, appeal, and use of vapor products,” while pressing for raising the age limit on smoking products to 21.
The FTC declined to comment, but in general does not confirm whether it is investigating a company, and all its investigations are nonpublic.
The US Food and Drug Administration chief last year sent a warning letter to JUUL about sales of products to minors and warned of an “epidemic” of vaping among youths amid a massive nationwide crackdown on e-cigarette brands.

Weak systems and funding gaps jeopardize drinking-water in world’s poorest countries,"
The World Health Organization (WHO) and UN-Water have sounded the alarm for an urgent increase in investment in strong drinking-water and sanitation systems.
The call came as the international water sector meets in Stockholm for its annual conference during World Water Week (25-30 August 2019).
It is triggered by a new report published by WHO on behalf of UN-Water that reveals that weak government systems and a lack of human resources and funds are jeopardizing the delivery of water and sanitation services in the world’s poorest countries – and undermining efforts to ensure health for all.

 “Too many people lack access to reliable and safe drinking water, toilets and hand-washing facilities, putting them at risk of deadly infections and threatening progress in public health,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Water and sanitation systems don’t just improve health and save lives, they are a critical part of building more stable, secure and prosperous societies. We call on all countries that lack essential water and sanitation infrastructure to allocate funds and human resources to build and maintain it.”
The UN-Water Global Assessment and Analysis of Sanitation and Drinking-Water 2019 (known as the GLAAS report) surveyed 115 countries and territories, representing 4.5 billion people. It showed that, in an overwhelming majority of countries, the implementation of water, sanitation and hygiene policies and plans is constrained by inadequate human and financial resources. Nineteen countries and one territory reported a funding gap of more than 60% between identified needs and available funding. Less than 15% of countries have the financial or human resources needed to implement their plans.
“If we are to create a healthier, more equitable and stable society, then strengthening the systems to reach those currently living without safe and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene services must be a top priority,” says Mr Gilbert F Houngbo, Chair of UN-Water and President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. “While we need to ensure that there is sufficient funding to tackle these critical challenges, it is equally important to continue reinforcing national delivery systems.”
While funding gaps and weak systems are holding many countries back, the report also found that countries have begun to take positive steps towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water and sanitation.
“The Sustainable Development Goals have inspired us to take concrete actions at the national level to increase access to sanitation,” says Mr David Molefha, Principal Water Engineer at the Ministry of Land Management Water and Sanitation Services in Botswana. “We have developed a sanitation roadmap and are working to eliminate open defecation. With these actions, we are working to improve peoples’ lives.”
About half of the countries surveyed have now set drinking-water targets that aim for universal coverage at levels higher than basic services by 2030, for example by addressing water quality and increasing access to water on premises. In addition, specifically targeting open defecation will have a dramatic impact on public and environmental health.
As the international authority on public health and water, sanitation and hygiene, WHO gathers scientific evidence, sets and monitors standards, and promotes best policies and practices for ensuring safe, reliable water, sanitation and hygiene for all people.

Four European states lose measles eradication status,"
Measles cases are skyrocketing in Europe and the disease is surging in four countries previously considered to have eliminated it, including the UK, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned Thursday, urging countries to step up vaccination efforts.
“Re-establishment of measles transmission is concerning. If high immunisation coverage is not achieved and sustained in every community, both children and adults will suffer unnecessarily and some will tragically die,” warned Gunter Pfaff, the head of the WHO’s European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination.
The WHO said there were 89,994 cases of measles in 48 European countries in the first six months of 2019, more than double the number in the same period in 2018 when there were 44,175 cases, and already more than the 84,462 cases reported for all of 2018.

 Based on 2018 data, the disease is no longer considered eliminated in the UK, Greece, the Czech Republic and Albania.
Measles is considered eliminated when there is no endemic disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area.
While the disease is highly contagious, it can be entirely prevented through a two-dose vaccine, but the WHO has in recent months sounded the alarm over vaccination rates.
The UK reported 953 cases in 2018 and 489 for the first six months of 2019. In the same periods Greece reported 2,193 and 28 cases, Albania 1,466 and 475, and the Czech Republic 217 and 569.
“Each of these countries are examples that have extremely high national vaccination coverage. So these are not examples of countries that have particularly weak systems,” said Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s Immunization Department.
“This is the alarm bell that is ringing around the world: being able to achieve high national coverage is not enough, it has to be achieved in every community, and every family for every child,” she said.

Potentially fatal
Measles is a highly contagious airborne infection causing fever, coughing and rashes. While it can be fatal, with 37 deaths reported in the first half of 2019 compared with 74 in 2018, other complications include blindness and, for pregnant women, miscarriage.
Some 60 percent of patients in Europe in the first half of 2019 were under the age of 19.
Four countries were home to 78 percent of cases in the first six months of 2019: Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Russia — 60 percent of which were reported in Ukraine alone.
Meanwhile, Austria and Switzerland were confirmed to have elimination status in 2018, the WHO said.
Measles has been declared eliminated in 35 of the 53 countries in the WHO’s European region for 2018, down from 37 in 2017.
It is considered endemic in 12 countries, including France and Germany. In the latter, vaccination against the disease will become mandatory in March 2020.
According to the WHO, more than 20 million deaths have been prevented around the globe between 2000 and 2016 thanks to measles vaccination.
Worldwide, the number of cases for January 1 to July 31 this year tripled to 364,808, compared with 129,239 during the same seven months last year.
The highest numbers of cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, and Ukraine. The United States meanwhile registered its highest number of cases in 25 years.
The numbers are especially worrying as nine in 10 cases are believed to go unrecorded worldwide, according to WHO.
O’Brien said that in reality, around 6.7 million deaths each year were linked to measles.
The disease had been officially eliminated in many countries with advanced healthcare systems, with numbers steadily decreasing until 2016 when a resurgence began.
According to the WHO, the reasons for people not being vaccinated vary significantly between communities and countries, with a lack of access to quality healthcare or vaccination services hindering some from getting the jabs, while others may be misinformed about vaccines and the need to vaccinate.
The so-called anti-vax movement — driven by fraudulent claims linking the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, to a risk of autism in children — has increasingly gained traction.
Uneven vaccination coverage and gaps and disparities between communities, geographic areas and among age groups has allowed measles to flourish even in countries with high national vaccination rates.

Childhood cancer survivors face variety of heart risks,"
Childhood cancer survivors’ risks for heart problems may be broader than what was previously recognized, researchers say.
It’s been known for years that some treatments for childhood cancer increase the risk of heart failure. But in a new study of more than 43,000 children, Canadian researchers found young cancer survivors had as much as a three-fold increased risk of developing a variety of other cardiovascular problems, too, according to the report published in Circulation.
The new findings suggest that survivors of childhood cancers should focus on improving modifiable heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, said study coauthor Dr. Paul Nathan, a professor of pediatrics and health policy, management and evaluation at the University of Toronto and a staff oncologist at The Hospital for Sick Children.

 There’s a chance that there will be new cancer treatments that are less toxic to the heart, Nathan said.
“However, we can’t eliminate use of these (cardio-toxic) treatments completely because they are needed to cure cancer,” Nathan said in an email. So, it’s important to make “sure survivors and their doctors are aware of the risks and (know) what to look out for.”
The heightened risks also mean that childhood cancer survivors should be screened for heart disease so it can be caught early, Nathan said.
To take a closer look at the impact of childhood cancer therapies on the heart, Nathan and his colleagues turned to a pediatric cancer registry called the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario Networked Information System, along with health data from the general public collected by The Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) a nonprofit corporation.
The researchers focused on the 7,289 cancer survivors who had been diagnosed before age 18, treated at a pediatric cancer center between 1987 and 2010, and survived at least 5 years. Each of those survivors was matched in age, gender and postal code to 5 cancer-free individuals from the general population, for a total of 36,205 individuals in the control group.
Half of the patients were tracked for more than 10 years. During follow-up, 203 survivors (2.8%) experienced one or more cardiac events as compared to 331 of those in the control group (0.9%).
When the researchers analyzed their data, they found that even at relatively young ages, cancer survivors had a three-fold increased risk for any type of heart event and as much as a ten-fold increased risk for heart failure compared to their peers.
Childhood cancer survivors also appeared to be at increased risk of metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. And those conditions increased the risk of heart disease.
Cancer survivors diagnosed with diabetes were more than three times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and more than 4 times more likely to develop heart failure compared with nondiabetic survivors. Similarly, those diagnosed with high blood pressure were 3 times more likely to develop heart failure compared to non-hypertensive survivors.
This study is a useful reminder to not overlook traditional risk factors and more common types of cardiovascular disease in childhood cancer survivors, said Dr. Prashant Vaishnava, a cardiologist at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. “This is becoming a recurring theme in medicine as patients are able to survive diseases that once may have been quickly fatal. The treatment paradigm for these survivors shifts to management of those conditions which are ubiquitous in the general population.”
These days many pediatric cancer centers follow survivors of childhood cancers for possible heart damage, said Dr. Kirsten Rose-Felker, a pediatric cardiologist at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.
While many will just need to be monitored for the rest of their lives, some children suffer severe damage to their hearts from the cancer treatments, Rose-Felker said. “We’ve taken care of patients who needed a heart transplant,” she added. “The damage can be so bad that it completely destroys the heart muscle.”
The number of children who will need to be watched for heart problems is on the rise, Rose-Felker said. “There are half a million childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. and that number continues to grow as treatments get better,” she added.
The good news, Rose-Felker said, is that this is “something we can actually affect.”

Pureed peanuts advised for infants to stave off allergy,"
Feeding pureed peanut products regularly to babies before their first birthday could reduce their risk of developing peanut allergies later on, doctors advise.
In a practice guide for health care providers published in CMAJ, a team of pediatricians and allergy specialists encourage introducing peanuts in pureed or powdered form as early as age 4 months for most babies, and making sure the babies continue to get exposure to “substantial” amounts of peanut products in their first years of life.
However, the allergy status of the baby should be checked with a doctor in advance, said one of the guide’s authors, Dr. George du Toit of King’s College London in the UK.

 He added that at-home introduction of peanut products is best suited for infants who do not have eczema, or have only a mild form of the skin disorder.
The hardest part of implementing the current guidelines regarding peanut exposure for babies is that they “are a complete reversal from the prior practice of delaying peanut exposure,” said Dr. Ruchi Gupta of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, a pediatrician and food allergy researcher who wasn’t involved in the practice guide.
“There’s also resistance from parents because they’re fearful about doing this at home with their infants and what may happen,” she told Reuters Health in a phone interview.
Peanut allergies typically develop before age 2. These allergies are a constant worry for parents, who need to closely monitor everything their kids eat inside and outside the home.
Allergic reactions to peanuts can include skin rashes and blisters, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, and swelling of the tongue, eyes or face. In severe cases, a peanut reaction can be fatal unless halted with an injection of epinephrine.
As a result, doctors previously advised parents to avoid giving peanut products to babies. But a 2015 study prompted a rethink of the guidelines.
The trial included 640 babies younger than 11 months with either egg allergy or eczema – both risk factors for developing peanut allergy. But researchers found that when these high-risk infants were fed a small amount of peanut butter 3 times a week, only 3% went on to develop peanut allergy after 5 years, while 17% of children who avoided peanuts during infancy became allergic.
In the practice guide, a team of pediatricians and allergy specialists recommends introducing peanut protein to babies aged between 4 and 6 months in the form of paste, butter or powdered puff as one of the first foods during the process of weaning off breast milk.
“A lot of people assume that this just means feed it to (babies) once but it is really important that you feed repeatedly and over a longer period of time so that the immune system actually learns to tolerate it,” said Gupta’s colleague Christopher Warren, also of the Feinberg School of Medicine, who joined her on the phone interview.
Guidelines from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommend checking the allergy status of high-risk infants through the skin-prick method or specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing before introducing peanuts. The allergy societies of Canada, Australia and the UK don’t mandate this test, the authors write.
The method of early introduction has also been tested with other major allergenic foods such as milk, egg, sesame, fish and wheat, but the protective effect of early introduction of these foods in a child’s diet was most pronounced in the case of peanuts and eggs, experts noted.
Parents should look out for signs of vomiting, choking, rashes, swelling of the lips or an extreme dislike for the food, which could signal the onset of an allergic reaction. But very few infants develop the more severe symptoms such as breathing difficulty or low blood pressure, Gupta said, and doctors are likely to recommend consulting with an allergy specialist to see if the baby could try peanuts again under medical supervision.

Ministry of Law drafts laws to amend NAB rules,"
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) - Ministry of Law today (August 30) has drafted new laws to amend the rules of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
According to the details, the amendment proposed to give the accountability courts the authority to decide the bail pleas.  NAB law won’t apply to a private person if he isn’t a public office holder.
The draft recommended that the NAB won’t take action against government employees on departmental defects, there will be proceedings against employees who have evidence to benefit from the defects. NAB will prosecute over 50 million corruption cases and scandals.
The draft amended by the Ministry of Law stated that a committee constituted by the Prime Minister Imran Khan will approve the voluntary return of looted money under the new NAB rules. Plea bargains and voluntary return of looted money will hold the accused ineligible for public office for 10 years. It has also been suggested to develop guidelines for the acceptance of the plea bargain.
In addition, if the NAB investigation is not completed within three months, the arrested public servant will be entitled to bail. NAB will not be able to reopen the case once it has been investigated. “If a civil servant was arrested then there would be 45 days remand instead of 90 days”, draft proposed.
To remove the power of the NAB from the stock market and tax issues was also proposed along with the authority to freeze the assets of public servants. The property of a government employee can be frozen only after a court sentence.

Pak-China Shaheen-VIII joint air exercise underway,"
BEIJING (APP) – The air forces of China and Pakistan are carrying out realistic operations very close to the real-combat environment with the best equipment in the ongoing joint annual exercise  Shaheen-VIII  aimed at enhancing their combat capability, a Chinese military observer said on Friday.
The joint training plays an important role in enhancing both sides  combat capability and helping them learn from each other through confrontation.
Based on the training progress so far, the Pakistani side has rich real-combat experience, while the Chinese side boasts advanced weapon and equipment systems and various cutting-edge technologies, Senior Colonel Du Wenlong said in an interview with  China Military  here.
He pointed out that both sides dispatched their typical, classical and leading equipment, indicating their confidence and the great importance they have attached to the joint training currently being carried out in China.
""Carrying out realistic operations with the best equipment, the two sides aimed at better confrontation performance and greater capability improvement,"" he added.
Colonel Du observed that the biggest feature of the joint training this time is that it s conducted in a back-to-back manner, whereby neither party is informed of the other s situation and has to find it completely depending on the early warning aircraft, predict its operations and immediately change the training plan. The training is more confrontational than previous ones that followed a pre-arranged plan.
Besides, all the confrontational exercises are carried out in highly complicated environment simulating plateau or mountainous areas, so the troops have to overcome the impacts caused by natural conditions and disturbing factors.
Since it s back-to-back without the communication of any information, the joint training features a keener sense of unfamiliarity and is very close to real-combat environment, with its indicators and plans all reaching the real-combat level, he added.
The military observer informed that both China and Pakistan assigned full range of troops including all typical elements.
For instance, China dispatched J-10C, J-16 and JH-7 fighter jets, and early warning aircraft, which covered such key elements as air strike and ground attack, constituting a complete air combat system. Plus the ground-based air defense early warning equipment, a full system of elements ranging from ground to air, and from attacking to commanding is exactly in place.
Pakistan dispatched the JF-17 Thunder and Mirage fighter jets, early warning aircraft and other ground troops, which was a mini version of the Pakistani air force given the types of weapons and equipment and number of services.
The air arm of the PLA Navy also assigned aircraft to the joint training. Both sides assigned a full range of troops and the quality of the joint training this time will be considerably boosted.
He said that with abutting mountains and water, China and Pakistan have become ""all-weather"" friendly neighbors since they formed diplomatic ties in 1951, and the two peoples enjoy profound traditional friendship.
""This is the 8th joint training between Chinese and Pakistani air forces, and the  Shaheen (Eagle)"" series has become a regular joint training brand between them, casting positive impact on the development of bilateral and mil-to-mil relations,"" he added.
About the future exercises, he said that there will be the 9th and 10th after the 8th China-Pakistan joint training, and believed this kind of joint training will become a regular practice in the future.
In fact, this kind of exchange serves as a barometer, which currently shows that bilateral relations have reached a very good state. ""We can conclude that the joint training is a win-win exercise that can not only deepen the mutual trust and understanding of the two militaries, but also promote the friendly cooperation between the two countries,"" he added.
Colonel Du opined that more similar operations will be carried out in the future, which will play an important role in enhancing the mutual understanding of Chinese and Pakistani officers and soldiers, especially deepening their perceptual knowledge and familiarizing them with the rules and with each other s weapons and capabilities.
The joint training is a strong driving force to continuously tighten mil-to-mil relations and have positive and far-reaching impact on bilateral relations, he added. It may be mentioned here that the Chinese and Pakistani air forces kicked off their joint training code-named ""Shaheen -VIII"", in a location in northwest China on August 23.The joint exercise is conducted each year in both countries on alternate basis. The Chinese air force contingent had participated in  Shaheen-VII , which was held in Pakistan last year.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-30-19/news_big_images/507304_23695700.jpg,pakistan,"

The rights of the Kashmiris cannot be violated, and they will definitely get freedom if we stand together for them, Dr Arif Alvi declared. The president added he strongly believes that Kashmir will be freed during our lives.
Dr Arif Alvi said Pakistan will answer Indian propaganda at every forum. He mentioned that Muslims in India are facing injustice in their own country. The president also stressed that we need a stronger Pakistan with a powerful economy to raise voice for Kashmir more effectively.
Local political leaders in their respective constituencies led protest rallies in which students and civil society participated in large numbers as Pakistani nation gave the entire world a strong message by expressing support to oppressed people of the occupied valley.











Sheikh Rashid

Federal Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid said that Narendra Modi has committed a mistake by scrapping Article 370 that gave special status to the occupied Kashmir.
The minister said Modi had thought that Kashmiri people are alone so he can do anything with this valley. He further stated that the nation will defend its country while standing with Pakistan Army.

Shahid Afridi

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi said Narendra Modi will be remembered as ‘Hitler’ when he dies.
The star cricketer addressed a protest rally – held on Prime Minister Imran Khan’s call to express solidarity with the people of Kashmir – at Mazar-e-Quaid and affirmed that Pakhtun community and tribal people are enough for Pakistan’s defense if India wages war against us.
The 39-year-old – wearing army cap and shirt – said he is a soldier, has always highlighted the Kashmir issue and will continue to do so. My grandfather was given the title of the ‘ghazi of Kashmir,’ he told.
Narendra Modi has humiliated India across the globe, and Pak-India relations worsened after he assumed charge as premier.
The cricketer affirmed that Pakistanis are standing with Kashmir from Karachi to Khyber. He also urged the nation to always stay united instead of waiting for any such event which brings the people together for a common cause.

Political leaders

Chief Minister of Balochistan Jam Kamal Khan Alyani said that Pakistani nation stands with Kashmir and that we will come out of our houses on every Friday in support of the Kashmiris.
Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri urged the international community to come out in support of oppressed Kashmiri people against the fascist and racist policies of Modi. “Entire world is witnessing that Pakistan stands shoulder to shoulder with their Kashmiri brothers,” he added.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) CM said that we have gathered for protest on the orders of Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan to record voice against human rights violation in IOK. Will continue to fight for the freedom of the occupied valley, he stated.
Chairman of the Special Committee on Kashmir Syed Fakhar Imam said the UN Security Council’s meeting is a clear proof that Kashmir is an internationally recognized disputed.
Sindh Governor Imran Ismail said that Indian government has unintentionally provided chance for the independence of Kashmir. This all was started by India but Pakistan will end it with the freedom of Kashmir, he stated.
Prime Minister’s Adviser and Hajj Coordinator Shehzad Arbab vowed to cooperate with Kashmiris in their freedom movement.
Let it be known that Imran Khan had on Thursday reiterated that he wanted all Pakistanis to come out on Friday to show solidarity with the people of India-occupied Kashmir (IoK).
He had urged all to give a clear message to the Kashmiris that the entire Pakistani nation stands with them and against Indian fascist oppression, the inhumane 24-day curfew, the daily injuring and killing of Kashmiri civilians including women and children – all part of the ethnic cleansing agenda of the Modi-government and its illegal annexation of IoK.
The plan to change demography of the occupied valley is a war crime under 4th Geneva Convention, the premier affirmed.
“We must send a strong message to Kashmiris that our nation stands resolutely behind them. So I am asking all Pakistanis for half an hour tomorrow stop whatever you are doing & come out on the road to show solidarity with the Kashmiri people,” he concluded.
Effective measures are being taken for another big event on the Defence Day (Sept 6). The next meeting under PM Khan is expected to finalize the plan for that day.
It is worth mentioning here that while addressing the nation on Monday, Prime Minister Imran Khan had announced that an event will be held every week to show solidarity with the people of Kashmir.
""They (India) have played their trump card; they don’t have any card to play now. Now whatever needs to be done will be done by us and the world,"" he had said as he took the nation into confidence on the government’s strategy regarding Indian-occupied Kashmir.
He said Pakistan’s Kashmir policy was at a decisive point and he had apprised the world leaders about the plight of the eight million Kashmiri people in Jammu and Kashmir.
Prime Minister Imran will address the UN General Assembly on Sept 27 to highlight Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir.

Pak-India tensions

Tensions have soared between the nuclear-armed rivals in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s illegal move to strip India-occupied Kashmir of its autonomy and bring it under Delhi’s direct rule.
The area is currently in its fourth week of a wide-ranging communications blackout with severe restrictions on movement. Thousands of people have been incarcerated in the crackdown.
In the weeks since the move, Imran Khan has launched a wide-ranging diplomatic offensive to counter Delhi, while vowing to fight India ""until the end"" if attacked and making occasional references to the possible outbreak of nuclear conflict.
Kashmir has been divided between the two countries since independence, and has been the spark for two major wars and countless clashes between the arch-rivals.
In February, the rivals again came close to all-out war, after a militant attack in Indian-held Kashmir, igniting tit-for-tat air strikes -- the first between nuclear-armed nations. Pakistan downed two Indian jets in an aerial dogfight of February 27 and captured an Indian pilot alive who was later released in a goodwill gesture.
The protests in Pakistan came a day after its military announced the testing of a surface-to-surface ballistic missile, with the army’s spokesman saying the weapon was ""capable of delivering multiple types of warheads"".

Kashmir valley turns into hell for inhabitants as Indian curfew enters 26th day,"
SRINAGAR (Web Desk) – In occupied Kashmir, the Kashmir valley has become a big jail and a hell for its inhabitants as they face severe shortage of essential commodities due to continued strict curfew and other restrictions imposed by the Indian government.

Confined to their homes, the residents of the valley are facing acute shortage of edibles, baby food and life-saving drugs due to the curfew and restrictions, which entered 26th day, today (Friday).
The Kashmir valley remains under severe military siege since August 05 when Narendra Modi-led communal government in New Delhi had announced scrapping of special status of occupied Kashmir by abrogating Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. Hundreds of thousands of Indian troops continue to keep the people confined to their homes to stop them from staging anti-India demonstrations.

Despite India’s brutal measures, people defying the curfew and other restrictions are staging protests on daily basis to express their resentment against the Indian occupation and nefarious move of Modi government. Hundreds of people have been injured due to the firing of bullets, pellets and teargas shells on the protesters by Indian forces’ personnel since August 05.

On the other hand, the occupation authorities continue to impose severe communication blackout by snapping all internet, mobile and landline services and closing the TV channels to hide the ground situation from the world. 

Due to curfew and restrictions, local newspapers could not update their online editions while majority of them could also not hit the stands all these days. Schools in the Kashmir valley continue to remain shut as parents are not ready to risk the lives of their children in the prevailing grim situation. 

At the same time, the authorities continue a massive crackdown against Hurriyat leaders, political workers and youth. More than 10,000 people have been arrested so far and detained in jails, police stations and makeshift detention centres. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-30-19/news_big_images/507258_19263816.jpg,pakistan,"

US must pressure India to end militarized curfew over Kashmir: Asad Majeed,"
WASHINGTON (Web Desk) - Pakistan’s Ambassador to United States, Asad Majeed Khan, has urged the US and the international community to “do more” to pressurize India to end its “militarized curfew” over the occupied Himalayan valley of Kashmir, stressing that the Narendra Modi-led Indian government has turned the Muslim majority region into “practically a concentration camp”.
Speaking to the Washington Times for an exclusive interview, Ambassador Asad Majeed Khan noted that the barbaric measures undertaken by India’s Prime Minister have confined Kashmiri Muslims into a “concentration camp” given the harsh restrictions on movement and everyday routine.
Asad Majeed Khan lamented that millions of Kashmiris living in Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir have been placed under a harsh security lockdown, which resembles a concentration camp, as civilians are denied access to electricity, life-saving medicines, telephones and internet for almost a month.
He stated, “Thousands are being put in prison. The world needs to be aware.”
Ambassador Khan praised US President Donald Trump for not taking sides in the long-standing Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan, however, he noted that the US must do more. Asad Majeed Khan said, “No other country has the same clout or influence as the United States of America to basically urge India, to nudge India.”
He continued, “India has actually laid down the ground to influence the demography of the state. They want to alter the ethnic composition of the state.”
Addressing the agendas of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Pakistani Ambassador noted that the Modi administration is closely aligned with Hindu nationalists who seek erect India into a historic Hindu homeland that has been ruled by invaders for centuries.
Highlighting Narendra Modi’s history as the Chief Minister of India’s state of Gujarat, he shed light on 2002 Gujarat Massacre, when the Indian state was marred with violence between the Hindu and Muslim communities. Reports reveal that the massacre resulted in around 1000 deaths of Muslims, while 300 Hindus also died during the riots.
Ambassador Khan noted that Modi’s role in instigating the violence had led to him being temporarily banned from entering the United States on orders of the US State Department. However, the world was shocked as he rose to power and assumed the Prime Ministerial office of India in 2014.
Asad Majeed commented, “Look back at his career. He was someone who was banned from coming into the United States because of what he had done in Gujarat in terms of killing thousands of Muslims.”
Ambassador Khan observed that India’s recent decision to abolish Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and scrape away the constitutional rights of Kashmiris is fueled by an agenda that stretches well-beyond forceful land occupation.
He said that these recent Indian measures in Kashmir are “not just about the dispute over land but the right of self-determination of the people, and I think what India has done is try to take away the identity of a people by reconstituting the territory, by redesigning areas.

Hundreds of locals staged a protest march following Friday afternoon prayers against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to withdraw autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir on Aug. 5.
Security forces were seen using tear gas shells to disperse the angry demonstrators.
Thousands of paramilitary police are deployed in the streets of Srinagar to quell protests stemming from India’s move to revoke a special status for the territory. Muslim-majority Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan.

"Britain, France, Germany to hold Iran talks","
HELSINKI (AFP) - Britain, France and Germany will hold talks Friday on how to preserve the beleaguered Iran nuclear deal and protect shipping in the Gulf.
Tensions have spiked recently in the strategic shipping lane where Iran has seized Western tankers as Tehran and Washington have locked horns over the 2015 deal.
US President Donald Trump last year unilaterally pulled out of the accord that handed Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its atomic programme.
The move alarmed European powers, which see the deal as the best way to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, and infuriated the Islamic republic.
The foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany -- the three European parties to the deal -- will be joined by EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini for talks on the sidelines of an EU meeting in Helsinki
All have repeatedly said they are committed to saving the deal, but efforts to shield Iran s economy from the reimposition of US sanctions have so far borne little fruit.
The G7 summit last weekend brought a glimmer of hope as Trump indicated willingness to talk to Iran and Mogherini said the EU would support such a move -- provided the current deal was preserved.
Ahead of the meeting, British foreign minister Dominic Raab said they would aim to ""build on the momentum of the positive G7 talks on Iran"".
As well as mooting the summit with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, Trump also appeared open to a French suggestion that Iran be given a line of credit to help stabilise its economy.
""The nuclear deal is the only deal on the table that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we will continue working together to encourage Iran to uphold the agreement in full,"" Raab said.
""We also need the broadest international support possible to tackle the threats to international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.""
Britain, along with Australia and Bahrain, has joined Washington s Operation Sentinel mission to protect commercial shipping on the crucial oil trade routes through the Gulf, in particular at the Strait of Hormuz.
Other European countries have been cool on the idea, fearing greater naval presence in the region could risk escalating an already febrile situation still further.
The idea has been floated of a European observation mission in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic choke point at the mouth of the Gulf, but a number of EU countries have voiced reservations.
Mogherini on Thursday gave a cautious welcome to the idea of US-Iran talks but stressed that ""first and foremost what is existing needs to be preserved"" -- including the 2015 deal.
In response to the US pulling out of the deal and reimposing sanctions, Tehran has breached certain limits on its nuclear production imposed by the accord, but the EU insists Iran has so far not taken any irreversible steps.

Regime forces inch forward in northwest Syria: monitor,"
BEIRUT (AFP) - Russian-backed regime forces seized several towns and villages in northwest Syria Thursday, as deadly air strikes hit the jihadist-held bastion, a monitor said.
Seven civilians died in air strikes in the south of the stronghold, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, a day after regime air strikes killed 12 others -- including six children -- in a town.
Eight years into Syria s war, the Idlib region of some three million people is one of the last holdouts of opposition to President Bashar al-Assad s regime.
His forces have been chipping away at the southern edge of the stronghold run by Syria s former Al-Qaeda affiliate for three weeks, after months of deadly bombardment.
Last week, the regime took control of Khan Sheikhun, a town on a key highway that runs through Idlib province, linking Damascus to second city Aleppo.
Overnight, pro-government fighters ""managed to advance in the southern Idlib countryside"", according to the head of the Britain-based Observatory, Rami Abdel Rahman.
They took control of the towns of Al-Tamaanah and Al-Khuwayn, as well as nearby villages, east of Khan Sheikhun, he said.
""The forces are trying to further extend their control in the area of Khan Sheikhun before they advance north in the direction of the town of Maaret al-Noman,"" he added.
Maaret al-Noman is the next stop northwards on the Damascus-Aleppo highway.
Regime air strikes killed 12 civilians -- half of them children -- in Maaret al-Noman on Wednesday.
AFP photographers at the scene saw rescue teams working to pull people from the rubble after nightfall with the help of bright spotlights.
A rescue worker pulled the body of a young girl from the debris, her lifeless form covered in white dust.
Her bloodied head and little arm hung limp as he carried her in his arms to an ambulance.
Inside a morgue, a young father sobbed over the bodies of his three children and their cousin, none of whom appeared older than five.
Also on Wednesday, another four civilians, including one child, were killed in other parts of the jihadist-held bastion.
Increased bombardment by the Syrian military and Russia since late April has killed more than 950 civilians in Idlib.
In the same period, the violence has displaced more than 400,000 people including many already uprooted from other areas, the United Nations says.
On Thursday, UN envoy Geir Pedersen called for an end to operations that are ""killing and displacing"" civilians in Idlib.
""No one pretends that there is any easy solution to the challenge of countering"" jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, he told the Security Council.
""But counter-terrorism cannot put three million civilians at risk.""
The bombardment and ground offensive come despite a deal between Russia and rebel backer Turkey in September last year to protect the area with a planned buffer zone.
That security cordon was never fully implemented, but Turkish troops deployed to 12 monitoring points around the planned buffer.
On Wednesday, the Observatory said air raids hit near one of the monitoring points in Sheir Maghar.
Turkey s state-run Anadolu news agency said the post itself was not hit.
Syria s war has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions more since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.

UN renews peacekeeping mission amid Israel-Lebanon tensions,"
UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - The UN Security Council on Thursday voted to renew its long-running peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for a year, warning of a ""new conflict"" with neighboring Israel.
The draft resolution, written by France and approved unanimously, would allow for the approximately 10,000 members of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) -- which was created in March 1978 -- to stay in place.
According to the draft text, the Security Council warned that ""violations of the cessation of hostilities could lead to a new conflict that none of the parties or the region can afford.""
It ""condemns all violations of the Blue Line"" between Lebanon and Israel, ""both by air and ground, and strongly calls upon all parties to respect the cessation of hostilities.""
The Lebanese army fired on an Israeli drone in the southern part of the country Wednesday.
That incident came just days after Shiite movement Hezbollah blamed an armed drone attack in its south Beirut stronghold on Israel -- an incident that President Michel Aoun said amounted to a ""declaration of war.""
""Urging all parties to make every effort to ensure that the cessation of hostilities is sustained,"" the Security Council called on all sides to ""exercise maximum calm and restraint.""
The resolution includes a requirement -- on the insistence of the United States, diplomats said -- for the UN secretary general to perform an evaluation on the UNIFIL mission and its staff before June 1, 2020.
Washington was unable, however, to reduce the maximum allowed number of peacekeepers deployed to 9,000.
Also at the US s request, the Security Council resolution calls for UNIFIL to have full access to the Blue Line.
It expresses ""concern that UNIFIL still has not been able to access all relevant locations north of the Blue Line related to the discovery of tunnels crossing the Blue Line.""
Israel has said it discovered and destroyed a series of cross-border Hezbollah tunnels since late last year.

Trump launches new Pentagon command for space warfare,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - President Donald Trump launched a new Pentagon command dedicated to warfare in space Thursday, as American armed forces chiefs see China and Russia pressing hard to erode the US advantage in the newest military frontier.
""This is a landmark day, one that recognizes the centrality of space to America s security and defense,"" Trump said in a White House ceremony.
""SpaceCom will ensure that America s dominance in space is never threatened.""
The new command will elevate space -- largely the satellites and high-altitude aircraft essential to modern-day warfare -- to a focused theater of combat, the equal of the US Central Command governing the Middle East and the Pacific Command, which manages defenses in the Western Pacific and Asia.
While the US Air Force already has a dedicated space warfare operation, SpaceCom will heighten its importance
and foster specialized systems and training for space showdowns.
""The dangers to our country constantly evolve and so must we,"" said Trump.
""Our adversaries are weaponizing earth s orbits with new technology targeting American satellites that are critical to both battlefield operations and our way of life at home.""
""Our freedom to operate in space is also essential to detecting and destroying any missile launched against the United States,"" he added.
Air Force General John Raymond, who will lead the new command, said ahead of the White House ceremony that US rivals China and Russia are already pouring huge resources into space operations, where they believe they can, in a conflict, diminish US advantages.
The challenges range from adversaries jamming communications and GPS satellites to, as China demonstrated in 2007, ground-launched missiles used to physically destroy satellites.
""We are at a strategic inflection point where there is nothing that we do as a joint coalition force that isn t enabled by space,"" Raymond told reporters at the Pentagon.
""I m convinced that space is a war-fighting domain. I m convinced that our way of life and our way of war depend on space capabilities,"" he said.
The Space Command is the Pentagon s 11th full command and second launched in two years.
Last year the Pentagon elevated its cyber warfare operations to CyberCom, recognizing that online attacks and defense constituted a unique theater of combat.
Trump though has a much more ambitious vision for space warfare.
In June 2018 he ordered the Department of Defense to create a much larger Space Force, a dedicated branch of the military equal to the existing forces, the US Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard.
That much more ambitious and expensive move would require Congress s approval. Some in the Pentagon, including the former defense secretary James Mattis, have opposed the idea as unnecessary and creating new bureaucracy.
""SpaceCom will be followed by the establishment of the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the United States armed forces,"" Trump said Thursday.
""The Space Force will organize, train and equip warriors to support SpaceCom s mission.""
Steve Kitay, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, said a proposal could be added to the Defense Department s budget in the coming year, calling it a ""strategic imperative.""
In China and Russia, he said, ""there is a perception that space represents an  Achilles heel and that this is an asymmetric advantage for them to then take on the United States  power.""
""Space will not be an Achilles heel"" for the US, he said.

Court bids launched to stop Johnson suspending UK parliament,"
LONDON (AFP) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson s suspension of parliament just weeks before Britain s EU departure date faced legal challenges on Thursday amid a furious outcry from pro-Europeans and MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit.
Johnson announced the surprise decision Wednesday to dismiss parliament next month for nearly five weeks, claiming his new government needed a fresh start in order to pursue a ""bold and ambitious"" post-Brexit domestic agenda.
But the move ahead of the October 31 Brexit date sent shockwaves through British politics.
Johnson s opponents labelled the suspension of parliament a ""coup"" and a ""constitutional outrage"".
The prime minister insists Britain must leave the European Union on time, with or without a divorce deal -- and the move limits his opponents  room for manoeuvre.
It prompted immediate court bids in London, Edinburgh and Belfast to halt the process.
An interim ruling is expected in the Edinburgh case on Friday.
Major protests were planned for Saturday as  politicians scrambled for ways to counter Johnson.
The leaders of the six opposition parties in parliament condemned Johnson s ""undemocratic"" actions in a joint statement, saying they believed a majority of MPs were against the move.
""We demand that the prime minister reverses this decision immediately or allows MPs to vote on whether there should be one,"" they said of the suspension.
""The prime minister is shutting down parliament with the sole aim of stopping MPs from avoiding a no-deal Brexit.
""Voters are being deprived of the opportunity to have their representatives hold the government to account.""
Labour opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would try to start a parliamentary process that would allow Johnson s opponents to legislate to prevent Britain leaving the EU without a deal and to stop the suspension of business.
Corbyn is also mulling a no-confidence vote in Johnson s Conservative government, which commands a fragile 320 to 319 majority.
Former Conservative finance minister Ken Clarke, parliament s longest-serving MP, has been touted as a unity figure to lead a temporary alternative government.
If it could lead to a ""sensible outcome of the present crisis, then yes,"" Clarke said of the idea.
As for voting to bring down his own government, Clarke told ITV television: ""If it s the only way of stopping us plunging into the disaster of a no-deal Brexit, then yes.""
Gina Miller, a businesswoman and leading anti-Brexit campaigner, has applied for an urgent judicial review in London challenging ""the effect and the intention"" of the suspension.
""We think that this request is illegal,"" said Miller who in 2017 successfully won MPs the right to vote on formally starting to leave the EU in a court challenge.
In Scotland s highest civil court, 75 parliamentarians are seeking an interim interdict that would stop Johnson suspending parliament pending a final decision on the case.
Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was caught on an open microphone at a Helsinki summit saying parliament was unable to agree what it wanted.
""So eventually any leader has to try. I don t know what the outcome...,"" he said, before laughing.
A Downing Street source said Wallace ""misspoke"". Johnson and the government insist the suspension is completely legal and simply a routine parliamentary procedure without a political objective.
Scottish parliamentarian Joanna Cherry, who is bringing the Edinburgh case, said the minister s comment ""backs up what we contend -- that prorogation of parliament is for an improper purpose and therefore unlawful"".
Meanwhile, campaigner Raymond McCord launched a legal bid in Belfast to block Johnson s move, with a hearing set for Friday.
""He s obviously trying to circumvent parliament and we say in the context of Northern Ireland that is unconstitutional,"" McCord s lawyer Ciaran O Hare told AFP.
An online petition seeking to block the decision unless Brexit is delayed or cancelled had garnered more than 1.5 million signatures on Thursday.
Thousands of people protested Wednesday in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and other cities.
General protests are planned outside parliament and around Britain on Saturday.
Labour s leftist faction Momentum urged members to ""occupy bridges and blockade roads"".
Meanwhile, leftists will rally outside parliament on Tuesday demanding an immediate general election.
After its longest session in nearly 400 years, parliament will now close in mid-September and reopen on October 14 -- just over two weeks before Brexit.
The House of Commons typically goes into recess around the annual party conference season, which kicks off on September 14 and ends on October 2, but critics slam this lengthier break.
The pound was stable on Thursday after sliding on news of the suspension.

India lockdown a major blow for Kashmir tourism,"
SRINAGAR (AFP) - On Srinagar s Dal Lake, intricately decorated houseboats usually packed with tourists lie empty as Kashmir s tourism sector reels from a three-weeks-long lockdown imposed as India revoked the picturesque region s autonomy.
With its breathtaking scenery, snow-capped mountains and placid lakes, temperate Kashmir is a popular destination for hordes of domestic and international tourists during the scorching summer season in the rest of India.
But authorities in early August called for visitors to leave ""immediately"" over ""terror threats"", sparking a mass exodus just days before New Delhi s controversial decision to bring the violence-hit region under its direct rule.
""They went to every houseboat, hotel and street to force every single tourist out of Kashmir,"" Shikara owner Yaqoob told AFP.
""Even now they go around hotels to check if anyone is left.""
Streets buzzing with locals and tourists are now mostly deserted. In their place are coils of barbed wire, security checkpoints and tens of thousands of extra troops New Delhi sent to the Himalayan region to reinforce the half a million already there.
Authorities cut off all communications -- including the internet and phone lines -- making contact with the outside world very difficult.
""This is not what we expected,"" said a Taiwanese couple, the only tourists AFP found in Srinagar, adding they had planned their trip a year ago.
""Nowadays not many people can live daily life without having all this modern technology, without the internet... That s kind of really hard for people, especially tourists.
""We are scared of the entire situation.""
Kashmir, split at the end of British colonial rule in 1947 between India and Pakistan, was a popular international getaway until an armed insurgency against Indian rule erupted in 1989.
The conflict, which has claimed tens of thousands of mostly civilian lives, has challenged efforts to promote tourism in the so-called ""Switzerland of the East"".
Tourist arrivals have ebbed and flowed over the years in line with the scale of the insurgency.
In Kashmir, the number of holidaymakers dropped from more than 1.3 million in 2012 to 850,000 in 2018, according to government figures.
But more than half-a-million people visited the valley in the first seven months of this year, with more than 150,000 vacationers arriving last month alone, according to official data.
In addition, some 340,000 religious tourists were visiting the valley in July before their Hindu pilgrimage was called off due to the terror claims.
A few days later, the valley fell silent. Just 150 foreign travellers have visited Kashmir since August 5 when New Delhi scrapped its autonomy, mostly people who booked their trips in advance.
The sharp drop-off is sending shockwaves through the estimated $500 million-a-year tourism industry, which employs some 100,000 people.
Many others make a living from related sectors including handicrafts, horticulture and transport.
The Indian government has stressed that bringing Kashmir under its direct rule would boost the economy and generate more jobs and development.
Locals are sceptical, pointing to the ""terror threat"" claims that sent visitors scrambling to leave on planes and buses.
""It was a lie. No-one was out to harm the pilgrims. They wanted to revoke the autonomy and used terror as a false flag,"" houseboat owner Basheer, who uses only his first name, told AFP.
This is not the first time the sector has experienced major disruptions, most recently in 2008, 2010 and 2016 when large-scale protests broke out.
But with no end to the current crisis in sight, residents fear the uncertainty will keep potential visitors away for a prolonged period of time.
Some countries have already issued advisories against travel to the region and tourist operators fear thousands of jobs could be lost, weakening the economy and further inflaming tensions.
""When your business is down and your basic rights are taken away, you can t expect us to remain sane,"" handicrafts store owner Sameer Wani told AFP.
""It will come to a do-or-die situation soon.""

"UN Security Council mulls calling for Idlib truce, Russia likely to oppose","
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is considering a draft resolution that would call for a truce in northwestern Syria ""to avoid a further deterioration of the already catastrophic humanitarian situation,"" though diplomats said on Thursday that such a move is likely to face opposition from veto-power Russia.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s forces, backed by Russian air power, have been waging an offensive in the Idlib region, the last remaining rebel-held territory in Syria s war. Much of the region is controlled by jihadists linked to the former Nusra Front, which was linked to al Qaeda.
Kuwait, Germany and Belgium circulated a draft resolution, seen by Reuters, to the 15-member U.N. Security Council late on Wednesday that would express ""outrage at the unacceptable levels of violence escalating in and around Idlib."" It was not immediately clear when they aimed to put it to a vote.
A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain to pass.
""Three million people — two-thirds of them women and children — are counting on your support to make this violence stop,"" U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council on Thursday.
The United Nations said that since the start of hostilities in northwest Syria in April, more than 550 civilians have been killed and some 400,000 people displaced. Almost half of the displaced people are living in open-air areas or under trees.
Russia s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy did not comment directly on the proposed draft resolution, but questioned the timing.
""As soon as the Syrian forces achieve some kind of advantage on the territory and begin to force terrorists out, our colleagues begin to say that we should stop military activity,"" he said. ""There is a need to have an uncompromising fight against terrorists.""
 

COUNCIL FAILURE

Senior British diplomat Stephen Hickey, speaking at his last Security Council meeting, said that despite best efforts the council had failed the people of Syria. He noted Russia s 12 vetoes of resolutions to shield the Assad government during the more than eight-year-long conflict.
""We must now come together urgently to stop the violence in Idlib and to protect Syrians from further suffering,"" he said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia and Turkey had agreed on steps to tackle militants in northwestern Syria and ""normalize"" the situation. Russian and Turkish forces in northern Syria are allies of opposing sides in the civil war.
The U.N. draft resolution also demands that all parties, particularly the Syrian government, must comply with international law, ""including the respect and protection of civilians and civilian objects, as well the respect and protection of all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel.""
U.N Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced earlier this month that the world body would investigate attacks on U.N.-supported facilities and other humanitarian sites in northwest Syria. Russia and Syria have said their forces are not targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure.
The locations of the U.N.-supported facilities and other humanitarian sites like hospitals and health centers had been shared with the warring parties in a bid to protect them. However, the United Nations has questioned whether it made them a target.
""The rules are clear,"" Lowcock said. ""People s homes, hospitals, schools, water systems and markets must be protected. There can be no reason, rationale, excuse or justification for the destruction of civilian areas on the scale seen in Idlib.""",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507208_75556127.jpg,world,"

"Trump: US to keep 8,600 troops in Afghanistan after deal with Taliban","
WASHINGTON (AFP) - President Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States will keep a permanent presence in Afghanistan, with 8,600 troops initially, even after a deal is reached with the Taliban.
""We’re going down to 8,600 and then we make a determination from there,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News radio. ""We’re always going to have a presence.""
Trump also warned that if another attack on the United States originated from Afghanistan ""we would come back with a force like ... never before.""
The comments provided some clarity on US intentions after lengthy negotiations with the Afghan guerrilla group over finding an exit from a war that has lasted two decades.
Despite overwhelming advantages in firepower, the US military has little to show for its efforts and Trump is hoping he can declare the war over in time for his 2020 reelection campaign.
Washington has been talking to the Taliban since at least 2018, with the main sticking point being how to get sufficient guarantees that Taliban territory will not be used by Al-Qaeda or other international militant groups to plot attacks on the United States.
There are currently around 14,000 US troops in the country, a number already far down from a peak of around 100,000.
The Taliban want all US troops out. But Trump underlined that there was to be no complete withdrawal, keeping a force that would provide ""high intelligence.""
""You have to keep a presence,"" he said.
 
 ‘Not based on trust’ 
 
It is unclear what a US pullback will mean for the Afghan government, whose own US-trained armed forces risk a renewed onslaught from the Taliban.
For now, the White House appears to be focusing on ensuring US security, especially with regards to making sure that the Taliban keep their side of the bargain.
""We’re well aware of the history of the Taliban ... and its complicated history with Al-Qaeda, which is exactly why any deal, if one is reached, will be so stringently monitored and verified,"" a State Department spokesman said.
""The agreement we’re working on is not based on trust -- it will be based on clear requirements and commitments, subject to our monitoring and verification.""
US forces were first sent to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on US soil carried out by Al-Qaeda, which was sheltered by the former Taliban regime. About 2,400 US troops have died there and around 20,000 have been wounded.
Summing up the cautious US position in the Taliban talks, General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday that he would not call the process a ""withdrawal.""
""I’m using ‘we’re going to make sure that Afghanistan is not a sanctuary, and we’re going to try to have an effort to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan,’"" he said.

Top challenger of Afghan president says ready to quit elections for peace,"
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani s main challenger in a election next month has said he is ready to abandon his bid for power for the sake of peace, raising more questions about prospects for an election the Taliban have vowed to block.
The twice-delayed presidential election comes as the United States and the Taliban are trying to seal an agreement under which U.S. forces will withdraw in exchange for a Taliban security guarantee and a promise of power-sharing talks with Ghani s government.
The Taliban have denounced the election as a sham and vowed to attack rallies. Ghani is insisting an election he looks set to win should go ahead.
Ghani s main challenger, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, told a campaign rally on Wednesday he would drop out of the race if that could help secure peace.
""My team is ready to quit elections for the sake of peace,"" Abdullah said, according to his office.
The Taliban want the election cancelled as a condition for so-called intra-Afghan dialogue - talks after the agreement with the United States is struck on how power can be shared and the country organised - and a ceasefire.
Abdullah, a former foreign minister, was Ghani s main challenger in the last election, in 2014.
That vote was marred by extensive fraud and Ghani became president after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry brokered a deal creating the post of chief executive for Abdullah.
Ghani has rejected a suggestion put forward by Western allies to postpone the election and form an interim government, perhaps with Taliban representative, after the militants strike their deal with the United States.
Ghani has said the people must be allowed to choose their leader and peace can only be secured under a democratic system. But the departure of his main challenger could undermine the legitimacy of the election. 

BOYCOTT?

This month, another main contender, Hanif Atmar, a former interior minister who also served as Ghani s national security adviser, suspended his campaign, citing the level of violence in the country.
The campaign opened in July with an insurgent attack on the Kabul office of Ghani s running mate, Amrullah Saleh. At least 20 people were killed and 50 wounded.
""With Atmar out of the race and Abdullah now giving preference to the peace deal instead of elections, it is quite clear that Ghani will have to realign his stance,"" said a Western diplomat in Kabul.
Opposition party sources said many of the 17 candidates in the race were considering a boycott because they believed Ghani was using state apparatus to help him win.
With both the Taliban and U.S. negotiators reporting progress in their talks in recent weeks, and raising the prospect of an end to the 18-year war, the election has yet to capture much attention from the public.
The U.S. special representative for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been leading the talks with the Taliban since last year, is scheduled to travel from Doha to Kabul this week for a meeting with Ghani.
Two sources with knowledge of the talks, said the United States will press Ghani to agree to postpone the election.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507165_37718474.jpg,world,"

Yemen government accuses UAE of launching air strikes on its troops,"
(AFP) – Yemen s government Thursday accused the UAE of launching air strikes against its troops in the interim capital Aden in support of separatists who say they have regained control of the southern city.
The United Arab Emirates has trained and supported separatists who seek an independent southern Yemen, although it is a key pillar in a Saudi-led military coalition backing the Yemeni government against Iran-aligned Huthi rebels.
""The Yemeni government condemns the Emirati air strikes against government forces in the interim capital Aden and in Zinjibar, which resulted in civilian and military casualties,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad al-Hadhrami said in a tweet.
He urged coalition leader Saudi Arabia ""to stand by the legitimate government and stop this illegal and unjustified military escalation"".
The accusation by Yemen s internationally recognised government indicates a widening rift between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, both of which have called for a ceasefire in Aden.
The clashes between separatists and government forces -- who for years fought on the same side against the Huthis -- have raised concerns that the famine-threatened country could break apart entirely.
The deputy foreign minister did not say when the alleged air strikes took place.
But residents in Aden told AFP they heard air raids late Wednesday when forces loyal to Yemeni President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi entered Aden, which separatists had captured earlier this month.
On Thursday a spokesman for the separatists  Southern Transitional Council (STC) said the UAE-backed Security Belt Forces were in full control of Aden after renewed clashes with government forces.

Reinforcements 

""The Security Belt force completely controls the city of Aden along with its entrances,"" spokesman Haitham Nezar told AFP.
A government security source confirmed Aden was under the full control of the STC, saying government troops who entered parts of the city a day earlier ""withdrew from Aden"" to Abyan province.
The STC-dominated separatists brought massive reinforcements from other regions, officials from both sides said.
Nezar said the Security Belt forces were now setting their sights on the nearby provinces of Abyan and Shabwa, which had been retaken by government troops earlier this week.
""Our plan is to kick out the invading forces from the south,"" said Nezar, referring to government forces seen by the separatists as outsiders.
The Yemeni government has also drafted in reinforcements from the north as the two parties appear to be preparing for a major showdown for supremacy in the south of the Arabian Peninsula nation.
STC vice president Hani bin Breik posted pictures of himself and other southern leaders touring the streets of the city including the airport, while warning fleeing government loyalists of punishment.
Thousands of Security Belt troops, dominated by the STC, were recalled from several parts of the country, including from the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, to reinforce the separatists in Aden.
Bin Breik said that STC forces fighting against the Huthis in the north were sent to the south for a major battle.
""We will not remain in the (battle) fronts to liberate the north from the Huthis while the north is invading us,"" he said.
The STC is fighting to regain the independence of South Yemen which unified with the north in 1990.

 Dialogue only way 

Hadi s government said on Wednesday it had seized back Aden from separatists who captured the strategic city on August 10 after a fierce battle that left at least 40 people dead.
The fighting has opened a new front in a complex war that has already claimed tens of thousands of lives and sparked what the United Nations calls the world s worst humanitarian crisis
The coalition intervened in the war in 2015 in support of the government after the Huthis swept south from their northern stronghold to seize the capital Sanaa and much of Yemen -- the Arab world s poorest nation.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, meeting in Washington with Saudi Arabia s deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, called for a negotiated resolution with STC forces.
Pompeo and the prince ""agreed that dialogue represents the only way to achieve a stable, unified and prosperous Yemen,"" the State Department said in a statement.
The meeting came after The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, said US President Donald Trump s administration was pursuing secret talks with the Huthis in hopes of winding down the violence.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507162_41947835.jpg,world,"

"Italy allows women, children off rescue ship","
ROME (AFP) - Women and children stuck on a charity rescue vessel in the Mediterranean will be allowed into Italy, the interior ministry said Thursday, though a ban on the ship entering Italian waters remains.
""Women, children and sick people will be allowed off the Mare Jonio,"" the ministry said in reference to the ship run by Mediterranea Saving Humans which had picked up some 100 migrants on Wednesday.
Those pulled to safety included 22 small children and 26 women -- eight of whom are pregnant -- who had survived their foundering dinghy being pummelled by a wave fellow occupants said drowned six people.
""The ban on (the vessel) entering Italian waters remains,"" the ministry said.
Hardline interior minister Matteo Salvini on Wednesday forbade the Mare Jonio from approaching the Italian coast, although he was effectively out of a job after Giuseppe Conte was asked to form a new government on Thursday.
Italy has repeatedly refused to allow charity vessels to dock until other EU nations agree to take in the migrants on them while Salvini was in power for the last 14 months.

"Toll in Japan rains hit 3, some evacuation orders lifted","
TOKYO (AFP) - The death toll from heavy rains in Japan rose to three on Thursday, as authorities urged local authorities to stay on alert despite the lifting of some evacuation orders.
The third victim in the rains that prompted the weather agency to issue its highest level warning earlier this week was discovered in a flooded home in southwestern Saga prefecture, officials said.
""An autopsy determined that she had drowned,"" Saga police spokesman Hiroshi Dan told AFP of the 96-year-old woman.
""When rescuers went to the house yesterday, they didn’t see her as the water was already nearly one-metre (3.3-foot) high.""
Two other deaths were confirmed Wednesday in Saga and neighbouring Fukuoka prefecture. And officials said one person was in critical condition and another was missing in Saga.
Authorities meanwhile lifted evacuation orders that on Wednesday applied to 870,000 people.
By Thursday afternoon, 392,000 people were under orders to seek shelter, while another 884,000 were under lower-level evacuation advisories, according to the national disaster management agency.
The weather agency has also downgraded its warnings for the region from the highest ""emergency warning"" to the second-highest level, but warned residents must to remain alert for landslides and flooding.
The agency forecasts more heavy rains could hit northern Kyushu and other areas in the coming days, although floodwater has receded now in some areas.
Evacuation orders and advisories issued by local authorities are not mandatory, although officials urge residents to heed them.
In one of the hardest-hit towns, Omachi in Saga, nurses were arriving on boats to hospital that was cut off by floodwater, while authorities were battling an oil leak from a small local steelworks.
Japanese authorities regularly urge people to take evacuation orders seriously, particularly after disastrous heavy rains last summer in Japan’s west killed more than 200 people. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507120_90883839.jpg,world,"The third victim in the rains that prompted the weather agency to issue its highest level warning earlier this week was discovered in a flooded home in southwestern Saga prefecture, officials said.",negative
Thai court upholds death penalty for Myanmar workers in British tourist murders,"
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand’s Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the death sentences of two migrant workers from Myanmar for the murder of two British backpackers that drew world attention to the tourist island of Koh Tao.

The September 2014 murders sullied Thailand’s image in the tourism industry, which makes up about a tenth of its economy.

The workers, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, were sentenced to death for the murder of David Miller, 24 and the murder and rape of Hannah Witheridge, 23, on the diving haven of Koh Tao.

Police said Witheridge had been raped and bludgeoned to death and Miller had suffered blows to his head.

A panel of two Supreme Court judges ruled on Thursday to uphold the death sentences handed down by lower courts, saying the men had been found guilty of murder and rape on the basis of evidence and forensic results.

The men displayed no emotion as they listened intently to a translator while the verdict was read at a court in the province of Nonthaburi, just north of Bangkok, the capital.

“Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun said afterwards that they are sad and worried by the verdict, because they said they did not commit the crime,” the court translator, Aye Mar Cho, told Reuters afterwards.

Their lawyer said they would seek a pardon from Thailand’s king.

“We will petition for royal pardon within 60 days so they would not be executed,” the lawyer, Nakhon Chompuchart, told reporters.

Thai law grants those sentenced to death 60 days to seek such a pardon, but if the king dismisses the request an execution can go ahead.

A murder convict was executed in June last year by lethal injection, but for the previous nine years all death sentences had been commuted by royal pardon.

Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun were convicted and sentenced to death in 2015, a verdict upheld by the appeal court in 2017.

A pro-bono legal team defending the men has said evidence collected by police was substandard. The lawyers have also said they were tortured and coerced into making confessions they later retracted.

“DNA and forensics evidence ... was in my opinion fundamentally flawed and should always have been considered unreliable, when considered against international standards,” said labor activist Andy Hall.

The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected accusations of torture and ruled that DNA evidence linked the workers to the crime. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507113_22412849.jpg,world,"A panel of two Supreme Court judges ruled on Thursday to uphold the death sentences handed down by lower courts, saying the men had been found guilty of murder and rape on the basis of evidence and forensic results.",negative
US must observe nuclear deal if it wants talks: Iran,"
KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - The United States must observe a landmark nuclear deal and halt ""economic terrorism"" against Iran if it wants to hold talks, the Islamic republic’s foreign minister said Thursday.
Tehran and Washington have been locked in a bitter standoff since last year when US President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out of the 2015 deal that gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its atomic programme.
Trump said Monday he was ready to meet Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani within weeks, in a potential breakthrough reached during a G7 summit in the French seaside resort of Biarritz.
But Rouhani has said Washington must first lift sanctions imposed since its withdrawal from the nuclear deal, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif reiterated that message.
""The United States is engaged in economic war against the Iranian people, and it won’t be possible for us to engage with the United States unless they stop imposing a war, engaging in economic terrorism against the Iranian people,"" he told reporters during a visit to Malaysia,
""We spoke to the United States, we spoke at length with the United States, we reached an agreement and they need to implement the agreement that we have reached before they expect to have more talks,"" he added, referring to the nuclear deal.
Iran was still talking to other world powers involved in the deal, he said.
""If (the US) wants to come back to the room there is a ticket that they need to purchase, and that ticket is to observe the agreement,"" he added.
Trump’s announcement this week came after Zarif travelled to France on Sunday for the second time in a matter of days, and held meetings on the sidelines of the G7 summit.
US Defense Secretary Mark Esper also called Wednesday for Iran to enter discussions with the US to ease tensions in the Gulf region.
""We are not seeking conflict with Iran. We want to engage with them diplomatically,"" Esper said.
In response to the US withdrawal and its imposition of crippling sanctions, Iran has hit back by abandoning commitments under the nuclear deal. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507082_67979328.jpg,world,"""The United States is engaged in economic war against the Iranian people, and it won’t be possible for us to engage with the United States unless they stop imposing a war, engaging in economic terrorism against the Iranian people,"" he told reporters during a visit to Malaysia,

China rotates Hong Kong troops as protesters call for democracy,"
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China rotated troops in its People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong on Thursday, days before protesters planned to hold a march calling for full democracy for the Chinese-ruled city after three months of sometimes violent demonstrations.

Chinese state media described the troop movement in the early hours as routine and Asian and Western diplomats watching PLA movements in the former British colony had been expecting it.

But, even if routine, the timing is likely to hit nerves in the “special administrative region” of Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997.

The Chinese statement last year said the number of soldiers and amount of equipment of the troops stationed in Hong Kong “was maintained with no change”.

That was not in Thursday’s announcement.

China’s military will make even greater “new” contributions to maintaining Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, state news agency Xinhua cited the People’s Liberation Army garrison in the territory as saying.

The military has completed a routine troop rotation in Hong Kong, with air, land and maritime forces having entered the territory, the report said.

Observers estimate the Hong Kong garrison numbers between 8,000 and 10,000 troops split between bases in southern China and a network of former British army barracks in Hong Kong.

China has denounced the protests and accused the United States and Britain of interfering in its affairs in Hong Kong. It has sent clear warnings that forceful intervention is possible.

Beijing warned again on Tuesday against foreign governments interfering in the Hong Kong protests, after the G7 summit of leaders of seven industrialised nations called for violence to be avoided.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has also not ruled out the possibility her administration could invoke emergency powers to quell the protests. She said in a news briefing on Tuesday that violence was becoming more serious but was confident the government could handle the crisis itself.

Xinhua said: “The Hong Kong Garrison of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army conducted the 22nd rotation of its members in the wee hours of Thursday since it began garrisoning Hong Kong in 1997.

“Approved by the Central Military Commission, the move is normal routine annual rotation in line with the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Garrisoning the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which stipulates that ‘the Hong Kong Garrison shall practise a system of rotation of its members’.”

China also rotated troops in neighbouring Macau, a former Portuguese colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1999.

The Civil Human Rights Front, the organiser of previous mass protests in Hong Kong that they said attracted up to two million people, plans a rally from Central to Beijing’s main representative office in Hong Kong on Saturday. Police refused permission for the march on Thursday, but the group said it would appeal.

The protest would mark five years since Beijing ruled out universal suffrage for Hong Kong. Activists targeted the representative office in July, daubing anti-China slogans on its walls.

The protests come as Hong Kong faces its first recession in a decade, with all its pillars of growth under stress.

Unrest escalated in mid-June over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.

It has since evolved into calls for greater democracy under the “one country, two systems” formula under which Hong Kong has been run since 1997, guaranteeing freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland that include an independent judiciary.

The protests have posed the biggest challenge for Communist Party rulers in Beijing since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.

Beijing is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1, when Xi will oversee a large military parade in the Chinese capital.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507065_24416139.jpg,world,"

Toll rises to 28 in Mexico bar fire attack,"
COATZACOALCOS (AFP) - Gunmen burst into a Mexican strip club in a hail of bullets and killed at least 28 people as they trapped revelers inside and started a raging fire, officials said Wednesday.
Many of the dead were dancers who worked there, according to managers.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador condemned the ""shameful"" attack in the city of Coatzacoalcos, and said federal authorities would investigate evidence it may have stemmed from collusion between local authorities and organized crime.
The Tuesday night attack, which also left nine people badly wounded, is the latest to rock the state of Veracruz, a flashpoint in turf wars between Mexico’s rival drug cartels and a hotbed of political corruption.
Survivors said gunmen sprayed bullets when they descended on the bar, the Caballo Blanco (White Horse), then blocked the exits and set the club alight.
Because of the loud reggaeton music pounding inside, many patrons and dancers did not notice the attack until the bar was in flames, they said.
Authorities said many of the victims died of smoke inhalation. It was not immediately clear whether some died of gunshot wounds.
""They arrived in several vehicles, with rifles and pistols. They threatened the security guards at the door and took control of the entrance,"" one survivor told an AFP reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, as frantic relatives gathered at the bar looking for their loved ones.
Veracruz Governor Cuitlahuac Garcia tweeted that authorities had identified one of the attackers as Ricardo ""N"" -- Mexican law bars the release of suspects’ full names -- adding that he was a repeat offender known as ""La Loca"" (""The Crazy One"").
The suspect was previously arrested last month, but was released by state prosecutors within 48 hours, Garcia said.
President Lopez Obrador said federal authorities would investigate why.
""There’s a problem there that needs to be investigated regarding the actions of the Veracruz prosecutor’s office,"" said Lopez Obrador, a leftist elected last year on an anti-corruption platform.
""There are two things going on here: one is this shameful act by organized crime, the most inhuman thing possible; the other, which is also reprehensible, is a possible conspiracy with the authorities,"" he told a news conference.
The Veracruz prosecutor’s office denied wrongdoing, and said in a statement it was in fact the federal prosecutor’s office that released Ricardo ""N.""

Attackers blocked emergency exits 


Veracruz is one of the most violent states in the country.
Its location on the Gulf of Mexico makes it a strategic route for drug cartels and for human traffickers bringing undocumented migrants to the United States.
Coatzacoalcos, a port city of 235,000 people, has been among those hardest hit by the resulting violence.
The governor told reporters the group that attacked the White Horse was vying for control of the drug trade there.
The interior of the bar was left wrecked and charred. The naked body of a woman who had been mid-routine was sprawled on the dance floor next to the striptease poles.
Ten of the club’s 25 dancers were killed, managers said.
""My niece starting dancing here a few months ago. She was a single mom, and she wanted to give her daughter a better life and go back to school,"" said Maria Vazquez, whose 22-year-old niece Sugedy was among the dead.
Local media reported two sailors from the Philippines were also killed. The Philippine embassy in Mexico City said it was investigating the report.

Hit squads, corruption 


Mexico, the chief supplier of narcotics to the United States, has been hit by a wave of violence since declaring war on drugs and deploying the army to fight its powerful cartels in 2006.
Since then, more than 250,000 people have been murdered, including a record 33,753 last year.
The situation in Veracruz has been particularly grim. Jailed ex-governor Javier Duarte (2010-2016) is accused of presiding over a rash of corruption and human rights abuses.
Two former state police chiefs and a string of ex-officials have been charged with running hit squads that abducted and presumably killed unwanted individuals during Duarte’s administration. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507038_88274940.jpg,world,Two former state police chiefs and a string of ex-officials have been charged with running hit squads that abducted and presumably killed unwanted individuals during Duarte’s administration.,negative
Taliban deal must ensure Afghanistan not 'sanctuary' for extremists: Pentagon,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The Taliban must ensure that Afghanistan does not become a sanctuary for extremists, top US defense officials said Wednesday, as peace negotiations with the powerful insurgent group appear to be nearing their conclusion.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was confirmed as the Pentagon chief just one month ago, told reporters that talks with the Taliban in Qatar must guarantee that Afghanistan ""is no longer a safe haven for terrorists to attack the United States.""
General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a deal on drawing down the 13,000 US troops in the country, after fighting for nearly two decades to what many call a stalemate, must not leave Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State (IS) group and other US-designated ""terror"" organizations space to continue their activities.
""I m not using the  withdrawal  word right now,"" Dunford said, standing next to Esper.
""I m using, we re going to make sure that Afghanistan is not a sanctuary, and we re going to try to have an effort to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan.""
Dunford said it was clear that there needed to be a negotiated solution, and one that involved not just the United States but the Afghan government.
""I view any agreement that would be pending is something we are doing with, not to, the Afghan people.""
""What is needed is some type of disruption to the status quo,"" he said.
""I think an agreement that can initiate inter-Afghan dialogue, potentially leading to a reduction in violence associated with the insurgency, is something that s worth trying.""
""I think any of us who have served there have long known that what s going to be required is a negotiated peace settlement,"" he said.
""We want stability for the Afghan people.""
Amid concerns that Afghan government forces are not yet capable of confronting IS, which has mounted repeated deadly attacks against the military and civilians, Dunford declined to say whether the Pentagon was planning to keep come counter-terror operations active in the country over the years to come.
Any agreement is going to be ""conditions-based,"" he said, and it was ""premature"" to talk about ""what our counter-terrorism presence in Afghanistan may or may not be.""
""The president and the secretary have made it quite clear to me that, as this progresses, we ensure that our counter-terrorism objectives are addressed.""
Meanwhile, both Esper and Dunford distanced the US military from a series of strikes Israel has allegedly conducted in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere targeting Iranian-linked weapons depots and supply lines.
Members of the Iraqi government have expressed concern about the attacks and a series of drone flights as violating the country s sovereignty.
Washington says it is only in Iraq for the US campaign against IS, and the Pentagon on Monday said in a statement that it did not conduct the recent attacks and called allegations that it did ""misleading and inflammatory.""
""We are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government... working with and through the Iraqi forces to execute the D-ISIS campaign,"" Esper said, referring to anti-IS efforts.
""Obviously we are concerned about anything that may impact our mission, our relationship or our forces.""

US defense chief urges Iran to hold talks with US,"
WASHINGTON (AFP) - US Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged Iran Wednesday to enter discussions with the United States in order to ease tensions in the Gulf region.
""We are not seeking conflict with Iran. We want to engage with them diplomatically,"" Esper said in his first formal press conference after being confirmed last month.
""The president said once again he is willing to meet with Iran s leaders,"" he said.
""We hope that the Iranians would agree to meet and talk and help us resolve these issues.""
At the G7 meeting in Biarritz, France on Monday, Trump, whose government has aggressively sought to pressure Tehran, showed openness to French President Emmanuel Macron s proposal of a summit with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani.
""If the circumstances were correct, I would certainly agree to that,"" Trump said at a joint press conference with Macron.
That could be the ice-breaker needed to end more than two years of heightened hostilities between the two countries.
Breaking with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump enacted a policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran over its disputed nuclear program and last year unilaterally withdrew from the landmark 2015 international deal that placed limits on Tehran s nuclear activities.
Tensions over that move have gradually risen, with Iran seizing tankers in the Gulf in recent months and Britain detaining an Iranian tanker off of Gibraltar.
In the wake of that, the US launched its ""Operation Sentinel,"" a naval operation to protect commercial shipping in the Gulf.
""I am pleased to report that Operation Sentinel is up and running, with the UK, Australia and Bahrain joining us in this effort,"" Esper said.
He said other countries would likely soon join, and that the operation had helped calm the region.
""Between our presence and the presence of our allies and partners in the region, I think so far, further bad, provocative behavior has been deterred,"" Esper said.
""We want to talk to Iran, and talk about a diplomatic path forward,"" he said, adding: ""I m not sure I m ready to call the crisis over yet. So far, so good.""

Toyota Motors offers free registration on purchasing 1.3L Corolla,"
LAHORE (Dunya News) - Toyota Indus Motor Company (IMC) on Thursday announced to offer a limited-time free registration on the purchase of all 1.3L Toyota Corolla variants.
According to the PakWheels, the Japanese auto giant always looks to attract its customers with creative and attractive promotions, and this time, it brings a free registration for its Toyota Corolla consumers. The offer is exclusively available for those purchasing 1.3L variants of Corolla which includes XLi and GLi. Overall, there are a total of four variants in this category according to their mode of transmission. These variants, along with their current (ex-factory) prices are mentioned below:
•	Toyota Corolla XLi VVTi (Rs24.99 lac)
•	Toyota Corolla XLi Automatic (Rs25.99 lac)
•	Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi (Rs27.49 lac)
•	Toyota Corolla GLi Automatic 1.3 VVTi (Rs28.49 lac)
According to the details, it’s a limited time offer valid only for the first 1000 units. The company also offers a three years warranty period or 100,000 km (whichever comes first) on all its models. The customers can visit their nearest dealership or check its availability online through the company’s website and book their Toyota Corolla today.
Note here that Toyota Corolla is the top-selling model of the Japanese auto manufacturer in Pakistan and leads the sales in its segment. However, in recent months, the sales of all the cars, including Corolla, have declined incredibly. The overall economic slowdown process in the country is the primary reason behind this plunge. In Pakistan, the company currently stands with a 22% market share in the passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.
The imposition of 5% FED on all the units of Toyota Corolla also jacked up the prices quite significantly. In addition to that, the rising US dollar against the local currency also left its massive impact on the prices of all the variants. However, on a year-on-year basis, the company sold 56,720 units of Toyota Corolla as compared to 51,412 units in the corresponding period last year, which is an increase of 10.3%.
The overall sales of the local auto manufacturer went up by 3.5% in this period. A total of 66,211 units of all the CBU and CKD units of Toyota were sold as compared to 64,000 units in the previous year.
Anyhow, it’s a great marketing tactic by the automaker to attract customers into buying its vehicle and lift the sales numbers in the declining market. The customers can also avail a financing scheme of the company which starts from Rs.48,755/- per month. Under the free registrations scheme, the customers can save up to Rs.60,000.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507195_76669414.jpg,business,"However, on a year-on-year basis, the company sold 56,720 units of Toyota Corolla as compared to 51,412 units in the corresponding period last year, which is an increase of 10.3%.",neutral

In previous weeks, the rupee was observed to cumulatively depreciate against the greenback.
The SBP had let the rupee depreciate significantly in the inter-bank market after finalising an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan programme on May 12.

The stringent conditions – on which the global moneylender has formally approved the bailout package of $6 billion for Pakistan – seem to have exerted more pressure on the local currency.
The gradual drop in the rupee had come due to high demand for the dollar against thin supply as the country continued to make aggressive international payments to partially pay off huge foreign debt and for imports.
Economists are of the view that effective measures must be implemented on the priority basis to recover the state from the balance of payment deficit.
Besides increased demand of the greenback in the local market, they have termed ‘balance of payments deficit’ as the main reason in the recent hike in the value of the US dollar.
Moreover, they consider that state’s exports and investment are required to grow significantly, and the imports must be reduced to remove pressure on the local currency.
According to experts, the government must ensure implementations on economic policies after the deal with the IMF.
It is anticipated that the US dollar rate would fluctuate for some time, and the value of the Pakistani rupee would stabilise after proper implementation of the economic policies.

This has not only supported the balance of payment but also strengthen the market confidence.
Furthermore, additional financial support from other development and bilateral partners will support the stability and inclusive growth.
The current account balance has shown a sign of improvement due to decline in trade deficit and increase in inflows of workers’ remittances.
However, slower inflow of Foreign Direct Investment is a challenge.
It was also highlighted that government has been making best efforts to operationalise the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) and the Export Processing Zones to attract FDI at the earliest.

Oil prices pegged back by mounting concern over U.S. economy,"
TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday for the first time in three days after San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly sounded a note of concern about the strength of U.S. economy.
Brent crude LCOc1 was down 30 cents, or 0.5%, at $60.19 a barrel by 0202 GMT while U.S. crude CLc1 was down 15 cents, or 0.3%, at $55.63 a barrel. Oil prices rose around 1.5 percent in the previous session.
Concerns about a slowdown in economic growth due to the trade war raging between the United States and China, along with the potential hit to oil demand, are keeping prices in check.

FPCB declares slower inflows of foreign investment a challenge,"
ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Monetary and Fiscal Policies Coordination Board on Wednesday declared slower inflows of Foreign Direct Investment a challenge. 
A meeting of the Monetary and Fiscal Policies Coordination Board was held on Wednesday under the chairmanship of the Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue, Dr. Abdul Hafeez Sheikh. 
The meeting was attended by the Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce, Textile, Industry & Production and Investment, Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission, Finance Secretary, Governor State Bank of Pakistan and two eminent economists Dr. Asad Zaman, ex-VC PIDE and Dr. Farrukh Iqbal, Director IBA Karachi.
The meeting reviewed the impact of Fiscal and Monetary Policies on economic growth, inflation, investment and external sector of the economy. While reviewing the Fiscal Policy, the Board observed that there is a need to narrow the fundamental revenue-expenditure gap and the export-import gap by ensuring prudent expenditure management and efficient resource mobilization strategy. 
The key economic indicators and impact of stabilization policies were presented to the Board. The meeting also reviewed the fundamentals of economy and the performance of the government decisions like upward adjustment in gas and electricity prices, market based exchange rate adjustments, increase in interest rate etc. The Board also discussed the options to enhance the economic activities in potential areas of the economy with targeted policy interventions. The possible options were also deliberated to control price hike in the country.
It was informed that the pressure on the external sector has also been relieved with the first tranche of IMF Extended Fund Facility, activation of the Saudi oil facility and increase in exports. This has not only supported the balance of Payment but also strengthen the market confidence.
Furthermore, additional financial support from other development and bilateral partners will support the stability and inclusive growth. The current account balance has shown a sign of improvement due to decline in trade deficit and increase in inflows of workers’ remittances.
However, slower inflows of Foreign Direct Investment are a challenge. It was also highlighted that government is making best efforts to operationalized the Special Economic Zones and the Export Processing Zones to attract FDI at the earliest.
It was emphasized that Policy rate may be regulated in a way to confine external sector vulnerability by focusing and prioritizing the export oriented sectors to generate more exportable surplus and become more competitive. It was agreed that SMEs sector should be uplifted by providing access to finance that will contribute to generate export surplus and to create jobs. The unnecessary imports is required to be restricted that has eroded the competitive edge of domestic industry. This will enhance the inclusive economic activities and improve socio-economic condition of common man at large in the country.
Keeping in view, the increased debt serving, lesser resources for public services and tight monetary policy the need for consistent and deep-rooted structural reforms was emphasized. It was also agreed that appropriate policy measures will be adopted to curtail fiscal deficit during the current fiscal year.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-28-19/news_big_images/507015_52411038.jpg,business,The Board also discussed the options to enhance the economic activities in potential areas of the economy with targeted policy interventions.,positive

Fake-branded bars slip dirty gold into world markets,"
LONDON (Reuters) - A forgery crisis is quietly roiling the world’s gold industry.
Gold bars fraudulently stamped with the logos of major refineries are being inserted into the global market to launder smuggled or illegal gold, refining and banking executives tell Reuters. The fakes are hard to detect, making them an ideal fund-runner for narcotics dealers or warlords.
In the last three years, bars worth at least $50 million (£41 million) stamped with Swiss refinery logos, but not actually produced by those facilities, have been identified by all four of Switzerland’s leading gold refiners and found in the vaults of JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the major banks at the heart of the market in bullion, said senior executives at gold refineries, banks and other industry sources.
Four of the executives said at least 1,000 of the bars, of a standard size known as a kilobar for their weight, have been found. That is a small share of output from the gold industry, which produces roughly 2 million to 2.5 million such bars each year. But the forgeries are sophisticated, so thousands more may have gone undetected, according to the head of Switzerland’s biggest refinery.
“The latest fake bars ... are highly professionally done,” said Michael Mesaric, the chief executive of refinery Valcambi. He said maybe a couple of thousand have been found, but the likelihood is that there are “way, way, way more still in circulation. And it still exists, and it still works.”
Fake gold bars - blocks of cheaper metal plated with gold - are relatively common in the gold industry and often easy to detect.
The counterfeits in these cases are subtler: The gold is real, and very high purity, with only the markings faked. Fake- branded bars are a relatively new way to flout global measures to block conflict minerals and prevent money-laundering.
Such forgeries pose a problem for international refiners, financiers and regulators as they attempt to purge the world of illicit trade in bullion.
High gold prices have triggered a boom in informal and illegal mining since the mid-2000s. Without the stamp of a prestigious refinery, such gold would be forced into underground networks, or priced at a discount. By pirating Swiss and other major brands, metal that has been mined or processed in places that would not otherwise be legal or acceptable in the West – for example in parts of Africa, Venezuela or North Korea – can be injected into the market, channelling funds to criminals or regimes that are sanctioned.
It is not clear who is making the bars found so far, but executives and bankers told Reuters they think most originate in China, the world’s largest gold producer and importer, and have entered the market via dealers and trading houses in Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand. Once accepted by a mainstream gold dealer in these places, they can quickly spread into supply chains worldwide.
Word of the forged bars began to circulate quietly in gold industry circles after the first half of 2017, when J.P. Morgan, one of five banks which finalise trades in the $10 trillion-a-year London gold market, found that its vaults contained at least two gold kilobars stamped with the same identification number, 10 people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Reuters couldn’t determine exactly where the vaults were.
J.P. Morgan declined to directly address questions about the fraudulent bullion, or comment on any of the details in this story. “It’s our standard practice to immediately alert the appropriate authorities and refineries should we discover mismarked gold kilobars during routine checks and procedures,” the bank said in a statement. “Fortunately, we have yet to have an incident resulting in a loss to the firm or a client.”
The Shanghai Gold Exchange, which regulates China’s gold market, said in a statement it was not aware of counterfeit bars being made in or transported through China. “The Shanghai Gold Exchange has established a thorough delivery and storage system. The process for gold (material) to enter the warehouse is strictly managed and in compliance with the regulations,” it said.
When others who store and trade such gold found forged bars, they returned them to the refiner concerned, some of whom have operations in Asia. Bars returned to Switzerland have been reported by refiners to the Swiss authorities who impounded them, refiners said.
Swiss Customs said 655 forged bars were reported in 2017 and 2018 to local prosecutors in Ticino, a region bordering Italy that contains three of Switzerland’s four large refineries. “In all cases the marking of the 1 kg bars were fake,” a Customs official said by email, without commenting further.
The public prosecutor in Ticino confirmed it had received three reports of gold bars with suspect serial numbers, but said it could not disclose more information. The police in Neuchatel, where Switzerland’s other large refinery is located, said neither it nor local prosecutors there had received reports of any forged bars. Switzerland’s Attorney General said its office was not concerned with the topic at present.
Refinery executives said forged bars had also been reported in other countries.


HANDY FORMAT

Kilobars are small - around the size and thickness of a cellphone - unlike the roughly 12.5-kilo gold ingots typically stored in the vaults of the world’s central banks. Kilobars are the most common form of gold in circulation around the world, passing fluidly between banks, refineries, dealers and individuals. The identifying features stamped onto a bar’s surface include the logo of the refinery that made it, its purity, weight, and a unique identification number. Each one is worth around $50,000 at current prices.
In parts of Southeast Asia, it’s not uncommon for individuals to use gold instead of cash for big purchases such as real estate, bankers and analysts said. “It’s the only investment tool that goes from institutional investors like banks to the public and back again,” said an executive at a Swiss refinery.
In China, almost all exports of gold are banned as part of the country’s strict, longstanding controls on capital movements. That, market analysts say, has spurred demand among well-to-do Chinese who want to send money out of the country to find ways to smuggle it.
An estimated 400 to 600 tonnes of gold are snuck every year across the border from mainland China to Hong Kong in car boots and delivery vans, most of it in kilobars, said Cameron Alexander, head of precious metals research at consultants GFMS Refinitiv, which conducts detailed studies of global gold flows. Hong Kong Customs said it had received no complaints in the past decade about kilobars with forged trademarks.
Japan also has a long-established problem of gold smuggling in which the forged brands could be put to use, refinery executives said.
Swiss brands are not the only ones to have been pirated, but are the most targeted due to their global reach, executives said. Switzerland’s four largest refineries - Valcambi, PAMP, Argor-Heraeus and Metalor - process around 2,000-2,500 tonnes of gold a year, worth around $100 billion. Their trademarks are among the most common and trusted in the industry.
PAMP and Metalor declined to comment on the record; Argor said there was always a risk brands would be counterfeited, and recommended people buy bars only from trusted distributors.
For recipients, the pirated bars pose a compliance threat: Anyone who holds such metal - including jewellers, banks and electronics firms - risks inadvertently violating global rules designed to keep metal of unknown or criminal origin out of circulation. The rules aim to staunch gold supplies that fund conflict, terrorism or organised crime, damage the environment or undermine national governments.
Governments in America and Europe are legislating to force banks and manufacturers of items such as jewellery and electronics to take more responsibility for their mineral suppliers. For example, a clause in the Dodd-Frank Act adopted by the United States obliges U.S. companies to disclose whether gold they use has come from countries in central Africa where it could have been mined to fund conflict.
Richard Hayes, chief executive of the Perth Mint in Australia, one of the world’s largest refiners, said his company had not encountered fraudulently branded Perth Mint kilobars. But, given the experience of other refiners, he has no doubt they are circulating.
“It’s a wonderful way of laundering conflict gold,” he said. “The gold is genuine, but it’s not ethically sourced ... They look completely genuine, they assay correctly, and they weigh correctly as well.”
The perfect appearance makes the bars highly effective. “Because gold is completely fungible,” Hayes said, “you can bleed it into genuine production. It’s very, very hard to control.”
J.P. Morgan supplies gold from major refiners for many of the world’s biggest banks, jewellers and investors, and the discovery of the forged bars in its vaults triggered a full review of the gold it held, market sources said. One said this sweep unearthed around 50 fraudulently-branded bars. Another said it found several hundred. J.P. Morgan did not comment.
People in the industry familiar with the matter said the number of forged bars, and their high quality, meant their production must be well organised. An analysis of the bars’ movements suggested they had been made in Asia, probably China, they said. But the gold in them could have been melted and re-melted after being mined anywhere.
J.P. Morgan responded to its discovery by deciding to stop buying any gold in Asia that had not come freshly made from a small clutch of refineries it trusted, five people familiar with the decision said. J.P. Morgan declined to comment.
Other banks have also restricted gold purchases in Asia, 15 people in the industry said. “Anything that has even the chance of being iffy they are not going to be involved in,” said Alexander, the analyst at GFMS Refinitiv.
Reuters approached five large banks that trade gold in Asia, several of which have vaulting facilities. HSBC declined to comment in detail but a spokesman said it only bought bars directly from a small group of refiners accredited, like the Swiss, by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). It said it had found no counterfeits. UBS did not comment on counterfeit bars, but said it only sells gold processed by LBMA-accredited refiners. Standard Chartered declined comment, saying “this is not an issue that affects us.” ANZ said it buys previously cast bars from “a select group of counterparties” and its policy, which had not been changed by the counterfeits, was to re-melt and recast them before selling them on. No one from ICBC Standard was available to comment.

THREE NINES

The number of fake bars being found has dropped since 2017. But refiners say the forgeries are becoming increasingly sophisticated, so the problem may have grown.
In 2017, Valcambi’s Mesaric said, hundreds of bars were found stamped with the same identification number. The bars’ markings also had spelling errors, flaws in logo images, or print that was too deep or shallow, other refiners said.
Today, the forgeries are more precisely made, using what appears to be sophisticated machinery, Mesaric said. There can still be giveaways, such as indentations from a robotic gripper or repeated imperfections in a cast mould. But these are easy to miss.
The most reliable way to identify the fakes is to test their purity. Gold is available on world markets in varying levels of purity: For professionally produced kilobars, the most common standard is 99.99% - known in the trade as “four nines.” An analysis of three counterfeit-branded bars by one Swiss refinery showed that two of them were 99.98% pure, and the third 99.90%.
Though short of legitimate professional standards, even that level of purity is difficult to achieve, and takes advanced equipment to detect.
Swiss Customs said of the 655 bars reported to local prosecutors in Ticino, the purity fell slightly below 99.99% in some cases.
“The level of counterfeit is becoming really good. Even for us it is hard to tell,” said a Swiss refinery executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They are, however, slightly less pure because the people doing the counterfeits don’t have the equipment we have.”

TAMPER-PROOF INK, MICROSURFACE SCANS

The refineries are responding to the problem with technology.
Metalor this year began to put spots of tamper-proof ink on its bars. Like the security features on banknotes, these display different features when viewed under certain light or through filters. PAMP and Valcambi perform a microsurface scan of their bars and supply machines or phone apps that can scan each one and verify whether their surfaces match the refinery’s records. Argor said its bars had various security features, but declined to elaborate for security reasons.
The LBMA, which accredits global refineries to vouch for the quality of their output, is drawing up standards for security features. It has also proposed a global database containing information about every kilobar produced, as a way of cross-checking the products to add an extra layer of security. “Any security feature can be duplicated that’s on the bar itself,” said the LBMA’s chief executive, Ruth Crowell.
But most of the refiners’ security features have only been introduced recently, and no database is planned until 2020 at the earliest.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-28-19/news_big_images/506941_76790814.jpg,business,"People in the industry familiar with the matter said the number of forged bars, and their high quality, meant their production must be well organised.",positive
Rupee depreciates by 24 paisa against dollar; PSX gains 311 points,"
KARACHI (Dunya News) - The Pakistani rupee continued to lose its strength against the US dollar as it slipped by 24 paisa in the interbank market and hit Rs157.5 during the early trade hours on Wednesday.
Yesterday, the local currency depreciated by 40 paisa in the interbank market.
In previous weeks, the rupee was observed to cumulatively depreciate against the greenback, which in turn had resulted in increased prices of goods and hardships for the general public.
The SBP had let the rupee depreciate significantly in the inter-bank market after finalising an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan programme on May 12.
The IMF has asked Pakistan to end state control of the rupee and let the currency move freely to find its equilibrium against the US dollar.
On the other hand, the World Bank Group has also supported the idea of leaving the rupee free from state control in an attempt to give much-needed boost to exports and fix a faltering economy.
The local currency depreciated massively despite receiving the first tranche of $991.4 million from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The stringent conditions – on which the global moneylender has formally approved the bailout package of $6 billion for Pakistan – seem to have exerted more pressure on the local currency.
The gradual drop in the rupee had come due to high demand for the dollar against thin supply as the country continued to make aggressive international payments to partially pay off huge foreign debt and for imports.
Economists are of the view that effective measures must be implemented on the priority basis to recover the state from the balance of payment deficit.
Besides increased demand of the greenback in the local market, they have termed ‘balance of payments deficit’ as the main reason in the recent hike in the value of the US dollar.
Moreover, they consider that state’s exports and investment are required to grow significantly, and the imports must be reduced to remove pressure on the local currency.
According to experts, the government must ensure implementations on economic policies after the deal with the IMF.
It is anticipated that the US dollar rate would fluctuate for some time, and the value of the Pakistani rupee would stabilise after proper implementation of the economic policies.

PSX gains 311 points

On the other hand, Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a positive trend on Wednesday when the benchmark KSE-100 index gained 311 points and recovered to 30,896 points.
On Monday, PSX had lost 830 points and closed at 30,520 points.
In the last week, the KSE-100 index gained massive 2,585 points to close at 31,350 points.

Oil rises as drop in U.S. inventories eases recession worries,"
TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, with U.S. crude gaining 1% after an inventory report showed U.S. stockpiles fell more than expected, helping ease worries about economic growth due to the Sino-U.S. trade war.
Brent crude LCOc1 was up by 37 cents, or 0.6%, at $59.88 a barrel by 0220 GMT. West Texas intermediate crude CLc1 was up 55 cents, or 1.0%, at $55.48 a barrel.
U.S. crude stockpiles fell sharply last week as imports dropped, plummeting by 11.1 million barrels, compared with expectations for a 2 million barrel draw, data from industry group, the American Petroleum Institute (API), showed.
The U.S. government’s weekly report is due to be released Wednesday morning and if official numbers confirm the API data then it will be the biggest weekly decline in nine weeks. 
“The mammoth crude inventory draw has, at least for the time being, put to rest those U.S. recessionary doom and gloom fears that have been hanging over oil markets like a dark cloud,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Valour Markets.
Still, concerns about global growth amid the raging trade war between the United States and China are likely to cap gains.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he believed China was sincere about wanting to reach a deal, while Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said China was willing to resolve the dispute through “calm” negotiations.
On Tuesday, however, concerns about trade resurfaced after China’s foreign ministry that it had not heard of any recent telephone call between the United States and China on trade, and said it hopes Washington can stop its wrong actions and create conditions for talks.
Crude oil prices have fallen about 20% from 2019 highs reached in April, partly because of worries that the U.S.-China trade war is hurting the global economy, which could dent demand for oil.
“Global recession risks are higher than at any stage since the (global financial crisis) and the U.S. is not immune,” Morgan Stanley said.
China’s Commerce Ministry last week said it would impose additional tariffs of 5% or 10% on 5,078 products originating from the United States, including crude oil, agricultural products and small aircraft.
In retaliation, Trump said he was ordering U.S. companies to look at ways to close operations in China and make products in the United States.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-28-19/news_big_images/506867_98676920.jpg,business,"

Australia star Smith returns but waits to bat against Derbyshire,"
DERBY (AFP) - Australia star batsman Steve Smith was kept waiting for his first innings since being concussed when he took the field in a tour fixture against Derbyshire on Thursday.
The opening day of this three-day fixture in Derby ended with Australia 77 without loss in reply to Derbyshire s 172 all out.
Under-pressure Test opener Marcus Harris was 52 not out and stand-in Australia captain Usman Khawaja, also battling to hold onto his Ashes spot, 18 not out against his former county.
Harris s fifty came off 77 balls, including nine fours.
Khawaja though was dropped on 15 when teenage quick Alfie Gleadall, failed to hold a caught and bowled chance.
Earlier, Michael Neser led Australia s attack with 3-31 from 11 overs.
But the uncapped paceman is not expected to make his debut in next week s fourth Test at Old Trafford, where an Australia win would see the holders retain the Ashes.
Smith, however, is set to return to Test duty in Manchester provided he comes through this match unscathed.
Mitchell Starc, yet to feature in this Ashes campaign, took three wickets in an over on his way to 3-46 in 16 but they were middle and lower order batsmen, with the left-arm quick off target with the new ball.
Derbyshire s Luus du Plooy, in at none for two, top-scored for the Midlands county with 86 before he unluckily played on to paceman Peter Siddle.
A good crowd for a tour match of some 2,000 turned up at the Pattonair County Ground -- many in the hope of seeing Smith bat for the first time since the drawn second Test at Lord s, when he was hit on his unprotected neck after being struck by a 92mph bouncer from England fast bowler Jofra Archer.
But instead they were kept waiting after Derbyshire captain Billy Godleman won the toss and decided the hosts would bat instead.
Smith s main contribution to the day s play was an over before lunch where the leg-spinner, whose warm-up delivery sailed over the head of Siddle, conceded five runs.
He bowled five off-breaks to left-hander du Plooy before finishing with a leg-break to Alex Hughes.
Having gone wicketless before lunch, Starc had Matt Critchley caught behind mishooking by Alex Carey for 11.
World Cup gloveman Carey was in as wicketkeeper for rested Australia captain Tim Paine, with Khawaja taking over as skipper.
Next ball Gleadall was clean bowled. Tony Palladino survived the hat-trick only to be bowled for a duck off the last ball of the over.
Smith s injury at Lord s, which saw Australia s Marnus Labuschagne become Test cricket s first concussion substitute, ruled him out of England s dramatic one-wicket win in the third Test at Headingley.
His absence was a blow to the tourists given Smith had marked his return to Test cricket following a 12-month ban that cost him the Australia captaincy with scores of 144 and 142 during a 251-run victory over England in the series opener at Edgbaston before his 92 at Lord s.

Sri Lankan 'mystery spinner' Mendis retires,"
(Reuters) - Sri Lanka’s Ajantha Mendis, who burst on to the scene as world cricket’s mystery spinner a decade ago, has announced his retirement from all formats of the game at the age of 34, the International Cricket Council said on Wednesday.
Mendis made his debut against West Indies in a one-dayer in April 2008 but it was his remarkable haul of six for 13 against India in the Asia Cup final three months later that turned heads around the world.
His trademark “carrom balls” - a disguised legbreak produced by flicking the ball between the thumb and the middle finger - left batsmen befuddled in the age of video analysis.
Mendis claimed 26 wickets in his maiden test series against India, a record for a three-match debut rubber, and also went on to become the fastest player to 50 ODI wickets, taking just 19 games.
Mendis took seven wickets in six matches at the 2011 50-overs World Cup but soon lost his spot in the Sri Lanka team as batsmen began to read his variations.
He last featured played international cricket in 2015 in a one-dayer against New Zealand in Christchurch.
He finished with 70 wickets in 19 tests, 152 in 87 ODIs and 66 in 39 Twenty20 internationals.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507078_70082217.jpg,Cricket,"Mendis claimed 26 wickets in his maiden test series against India, a record for a three-match debut rubber, and also went on to become the fastest player to 50 ODI wickets, taking just 19 games.",neutral
"'Best and worst day' now in past, focus on World T20 – Guptill","
COLOMBO (Reuters) - New Zealand’s Martin Guptill went through “the best and worst day” of his career during last month’s Cricket World Cup final against England but the opening batsman’s focus has now firmly shifted to the World Twenty20 in Australia next year.
Guptill was heavily involved in two pieces of action that defined last month’s World Cup final, with his throw from the outfield deflecting off Ben Stokes’ bat for four to give England a valuable six runs and allowing them to tie the game.
The 32-year-old Guptill was then run out off the final ball of the super over attempting the second run that would have given New Zealand the title. England eventually won their first 50-over World Cup by virtue of having hit the most boundaries.
“I guess you see it as the best and the worst day of your cricketing career,” said Guptill, after he joined New Zealand’s squad in Sri Lanka for their three-match Twenty20 series that starts on Sunday in Pallekele.
“The ebbs and flows of the game made it such a good one for the spectators. It was just unfortunate we came out on the other side of it.”
England’s spectators, still basking in the euphoria of that victory, did not spare Guptill as he stayed in the country on a short-term contract with Worcestershire to play Twenty20 cricket.
“I got a bit of stick from the crowd,” Guptill said of his matches in England. “I think it was actually even home games I got a bit of stick.
“It’s something you’ve just got to put up with and move on pretty quickly. I’m here now with the boys and raring to go.”
For the T20 games, Guptill joined a New Zealand side that included just four players — bowler and captain Tim Southee, batsman Ross Taylor and all-rounders Mitchell Santner and Colin de Grandhomme — who drew the two-match test series.
New Zealand’s focus over the next 12 months will be on the shortest form of the game, with the World Twenty20 in Australia scheduled for next October and November.
The Sri Lanka series, while not played in conditions they will expect in New Zealand or Australia, would allow the team to get back into the rhythm of the format, Guptill added.
“T20 World Cups are always good fun,” he said. “With it being in Australia next year it’s completely different conditions to what we face at home as well.
“It’s going to be nice to start off our preparation here, playing in some trying conditions and then head home with a good five (match) T20 series against England to lead off the summer.”  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507076_74398554.jpg,Cricket,"“It’s going to be nice to start off our preparation here, playing in some trying conditions and then head home with a good five (match) T20 series against England to lead off the summer.”",positive
PCB holds interviews for appointment of new head coach,"
LAHORE (Dunya News) – The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) conducted interviews for appointments of the men’s national team’s new head coach and other staff on Thursday (today).

Let it be known that two foreigners – Dean Jones and Courtney Walsh – have applied for the position of head coach while Pakistan’s most successful Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq is favorite for the post.
Misbah-ul-Haq had earlier stepped down from the Pakistan Cricket Board’s executive committee to clear the way for his application.

'Frustrated' Khawaja to lead Australia in tour match,"
(Reuters) - Under-pressure Australia batsman Usman Khawaja is “frustrated” after failing to convert a number of starts in the Ashes series but insists his batting is in a good place as he looks for form in the tour match against Derbyshire.
Khawaja, who will captain Australia in the three-day match while regular skipper Tim Paine takes a break, has failed to score a half-century in the three tests and is averaging 20 in a lean series to date.
The Australia number three is hardly alone in his struggles, with only Steve Smith (126.00), Marnus Labuschagne (71.00) and Travis Head (32.00) averaging above 30.
“I actually feel really good batting,” Khawaja told reporters.
“I just haven’t made any big runs lately, which is obviously frustrating for me and when you look at the team you’d like the top order to score big runs.
“I think we’ve fallen short of that in the top order and I think (England) have, too, in a lot of the games.
“I’m actually getting lots of starts, it’s not like I’m in no man’s territory. The most important thing is to capitalise on the starts, because if you don’t capitalise there are always times when you’re going to get out early.”
England’s rousing victory at Headingley levelled the series at 1-1, raising the stakes ahead of the penultimate test at Old Trafford.
As holders of the urn, Australia need to win only one of the last two tests in Manchester and at The Oval to be sure of retaining the Ashes but the pressure is back on Paine’s side after they let slip a commanding position at Leeds.
Khawaja will open the batting with Marcus Harris, who failed twice in the one-wicket loss at Headingley having replaced the out-of-form Cameron Bancroft after the second test.
With Labuschagne expected to be retained for Old Trafford and Smith reinstated after missing the last test with concussion, Khawaja’s promotion has triggered speculation he might be set to open with David Warner in Manchester.
The lefthander has played at number three for most of his 44 tests but has an impressive average of 96.80 from his seven innings as an opener, including two centuries.
He has never opened before in England, however, and his paltry average of 19.66 in six tests away to the hosts suggests trouble handling the swinging Dukes ball.
Khawaja was cagey when asked where he saw himself fitting in at Old Trafford.
“I’m not really sure at the moment, because Smithy is in there too, trying to get a game,” he said.
“But at the moment, it’s just about some guys going out there, playing some cricket, worrying about this game, getting ready for the next game and whatever’s out of our control, just leaving it at that.”
Along with Paine, Warner, middle order batsman Travis Head and Australia’s entire bowling attack from Headingley will be rested for the Derby match.

Aussie star Smith dismisses Archer threat,"
LONDON (AFP) - Australia s star batsman Steve Smith will return to action on Thursday after missing the third Ashes Test because of concussion and laughed off the claim England pace bowler Jofra Archer was his nemesis.
Smith, who has been cleared to play in the tour match with county side Derbyshire, suffered the concussion in the first innings of the drawn second Test at Lord s when he was hit by a 92mph Archer bouncer.
However, the 30-year-old former Australia captain -- who has scored two centuries and 92 in three innings in his first Test series since completing a 12-month ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal -- told cricket.com.au he did not consider Archer to be his bogeyman.
""There s been a bit of talk that he s got the wood over me, but he hasn t actually got me out,"" said Smith.
""He hit me on the head on a wicket that was a bit up and down at Lord s.
""He actually didn t get me out. All the other bowlers have had more success against me, I daresay.
""I ve faced them a bit more, but they ve all got me out a lot more.""
Smith, who in order to be passed fit for the Derbyshire game had to face short fast bowling in the nets to test his reaction speed and reflexes, said it might work to his benefit if the England strategy in the fourth Test at Old Trafford next week is to pepper him with short-pitched bowling.
""If they re bowling up there it means they can t nick me off, or hit me on the pad or hit the stumps,"" Smith said.
""With the Dukes ball I don t know, it s an interesting ploy.
""So we ll see what happens.""

Brearley rates Stokes's Headingley performance greater than Botham's,"
LONDON (AFP) - Ben Stokes s astonishing match-winning performance in the third Ashes Test at Headingley upstages that of Ian Botham in 1981 at the same ground, according to former England captain Mike Brearley.
""It is hard to believe Stokes s could ever have been, or even ever will be, surpassed,"" wrote Botham s 1981 captain in The Times.
Both performances included stamina and skill with the ball as well as a monumental performance with the bat, each of them securing narrow wins for England in cricket s oldest rivalry.
Stokes s 135 not out on Sunday secured an highly unlikely one-wicket win over Australia -- England required 73 when the last batsman Jack Leach came to the wicket -- and followed a monumental 24-over bowling stint in the tourists  second innings during which he took three wickets.
Botham s performance in 1981 was equally heroic. In spite of taking six wickets in Australia s first innings and then scoring 50 in England s first dig, Botham came to crease a second time with the English following on.
His unbeaten 149 transformed the outcome of the Test, setting the stage for Bob Willis to write his name into folklore with eight wickets in the Australians  second innings as England sealed a remarkable 18-run win.
Brearley likens Stokes, Botham and another celebrated all-rounder Freddie Flintoff, who was the star of the England s 2005 Ashes victory, to ""the finest specimen of the thoroughbred old English yeomen.""
""Vivid though the images from the distant past are, mental pictures of rampaging bowling and batting by all three iconic all-rounders, it is difficult now to remove from the front of my mind the shock, the exhilaration, of the recent: the sheer improbability of Stokes s performance at Headingley last week,"" wrote Brearley.
Brearley, regarded as one of England s finest captains, said the trio rode their luck at times.
""I like the story of the man who kept complaining to God about his bad luck in life; why would God not at least let him win the lottery?
""Fed up at last with these endless complaints, God barked down from the sky:  Do me a favour, at least buy a ticket. 
""Stokes, Botham and Flintoff all did rather more than buy tickets. By their courage, skill, conviction and genius, they earned their luck.""
Brearley, who is now a respected psychoanalyst, said there were similarities between Botham s Headingley innings and that of Stokes.
""In a way, Botham s 149 not out against Australia at Headingley in 1981 started where Stokes s 135 not out left off, with outrageous rusticity and defiance, in the quest for an apparently unreachable target.
""Echoes of the village green on the respectable arena of Headingley.""
Brearley, who won 17 and lost just four of his 31 Tests in charge of England, said all three players would be people ""to go into combat with"".
The 77-year-old also credits the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for bringing Stokes back despite protestations from some after he was found not guilty of affray in a court case last year.
""Some followers of the game were minded to exclude him as a bad influence on the young,"" wrote Brearley.
""It is to the credit of the ECB, and in the spirit of cricket, that they gave him a second chance.""

PCB welcomes LHC decision to dismiss petition against new constitution ,"
LAHORE (Dunya News) – The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday welcomed the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) decision to vacate an application to suspend the PCB Constitution 2019, which was promulgated by the government and came into existence on August 19. 
During Wednesday’s proceedings, a second attempt was made by the same petitioners to challenge and suspend the operation of the new PCB Constitution 2019 by filing a fresh case. The LHC refused to grant a stay and issued notices to PCB to present its response at the next date of hearing. No date of hearing has been fixed thus far.
Additionally, the LHC was pleased to dismiss more than a dozen cases relating to the election commission as well as grievances of terminated employees. 
PCB Chairman Ehsan Mani said that the PCB welcomes the judgement of the LHC Judge Justice Shahid Waheed, who dismissed the application to suspend the PCB Constitution 2019. 
He said that it was obvious to all the knowledgeable and passionate cricket fans and followers that the intentions of the petitioners were malafide and were aimed at disrupting Pakistan cricket activities and bringing embarrassment to the PCB and the country. 
The PCB chairman said: “Petitioners had approached the court to protect their personal and financial interests with complete disregard to the fact that their action could have resulted in severe impact on the 2019-20 domestic cricket programme. This ploy has been defeated on solid legal grounds and the PCB will now swiftly move to announce the new domestic structure and commence the 2019-20 season on 14 September.” 
Mani went on to say that the 2019-20 season will be a season of celebration for Pakistan’s cricket fans as we host Sri Lanka for three ODIs and as many T20Is from 27 September to 9 October. Furthermore, high-powered delegations from Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board will be visiting in September and October respectively as part of our preparations for their future tours to Pakistan.

Speaking at a ceremony held in Lahore in his honor on Wednesday, he said that Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) should give central contract to at least 20 umpires. 
Dar said that he has been umpiring for the last 15 years and demanded the authorities to increase umpiring fee for domestic match to ﻿Rs10,000﻿. 
Earlier, officiating in the second Ashes Test at the Lord’s Cricket Ground in London, Aleem Dar equaled West Indies’ Steve Bucknor’s record of officiating in the most number of Test matches.
The ongoing England versus Australia Test was the 51-year-old Dar’s 128th Test as an umpire.
“It’s a great honour to equal the number of Test matches of my role model, umpire Steve Bucknor,” Dar was quoted as saying in an ICC tweet.
The Bangladesh versus England Test in October 2003 in Dhaka was Dar’s first Test match as an umpire. Thus far, he has officiated in 376 matches across the three formats of the game.
While Dar and Bucknor are at the top of the list, Rudi Koertzen of South Africa is on the second spot, having stood in 108 Test matches before he announced his retirement from umpiring in 2010. Koertzen remains only the third umpire to have officiated in more than hundred Tests.

Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq of Delhi had built Feroz Shah Kotla Fort in 1354 which was converted into a cricket stadium in the 19th century, and is the second-oldest cricket stadium in India.
The authorities have announced that a formal ceremony to change the name of the stadium will be held on September 12. The move is inspired by the idea of Hindu supremacy.
DDCA president Rajat Sharma told that the stadium has introduced stars such as India captain Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Ashish Nehra to the world.
The stadium has hosted key matches including Tests, one-day internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-28-19/news_big_images/506919_89160339.jpg,Cricket,"

Shoaib Akhtar leaves for Australia for knee reconstruction,"
ISLAMABAD (APP) – Former pacer Shoaib Akhtar on Tuesday left for Melbourne, Australia to undergo a partial reconstruction of his right knee.
“Doctors are saying that I will have to undergo a six to seven hour surgery. Let us see what will they say when I reach there. How long the operation takes place and how much they want to implant?,” he said on his YouTube channel while onboard the Melbourne-bound plane.
The 44-year-old was of the view that as per medical rules any sort of knee replacement should not take place before one turns sixty. “It is unfortunate that it is taking place at this age.”
“I’ve been playing for Pakistan with pain in my knee. It has become necessary to go for its remedy now. I’ve left my family. I’ve left everyone and this is not a very happy feeling.

ISLAMABAD (APP) – Observing that former national cricketers are truly patriotic and can deliver their best to the players, Asian Bradman Zaheer Abbas proposed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to go for all local coaching staff for the national team.

Players be given longer chance for evaluation: Shan Masood,"
LAHORE (APP) – Pakistan test cricketer, Shan Masood, has urged the national cricket selector to give ample chance to players before evaluate their performance and deciding their fate in the game.
“I request the national selectors to assess the performance of players based on the number of the matches played by them and they should be given a fair chance to prove their mettle,” he told reporters here after a training session of pre-season cricket fitness camp at the Gaddafi Stadium.
He quoted his own example that he played only 15 test matches in six years time period with an average of two-and-a-half tests a year, compared to 30 or 40 test matches played by a player of different teams of the world. “It is not a broad way method to judge performance,” he said.
The left-handed batsman rejected a questioner that he wants to bat at a specific number in batting order saying “My job is to play quality cricket for Pakistan and, as a player I am available to Pakistan in every capacity (in batting number).”
He said it is good for the safety of players to wear protective safety gear, allowed by the International Cricket Council and it does not mean that if any player enters the field equipped with safety gears he has fear factor of getting injured as injuries are though happen in the game and the best way to avoid them is to follow the laid down procedure of ICC regarding the use of safety gear.
The test batsman praised the decision of PCB for conducting pre-season fitness camp and said “It is the first time that such a high profile pre-season having all the centrally contracted player has been organised, focusing on the fitness and skills of the players enabling them to get into required mental and physical fitness before playing the domestic circuit and the coming international assignments home and abroad.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-28-19/news_big_images/506861_76284985.jpg,Cricket,"The test batsman praised the decision of PCB for conducting pre-season fitness camp and said “It is the first time that such a high profile pre-season having all the centrally contracted player has been organised, focusing on the fitness and skills of the players enabling them to get into required mental and physical fitness before playing the domestic circuit and the coming international assignments home and abroad.",positive
Windies keep faith with batting lineup for second India test,"
(Reuters) - West Indies’ selectors have kept faith with the batting lineup that was skittled for 100 runs in a lopsided first test against India in the Caribbean on Sunday.
Only one player has been omitted for the second test, fast bowler Miguel Cummins who failed to take a wicket in Antigua.
He makes way for all-rounder Keemo Paul, who is available after recovering from an ankle injury.
The second test starts in Kingston, Jamaica on Friday.
India won the first test by 318 runs, with West Indies dismissed for 222 in the first innings before making only 100 in their second knock.
West Indies’ top order was especially disappointing. Openers Kraigg Brathwaite (14 and 1) and John Campbell (23 and 7) went cheaply, while numbers three and four Shamarh Brooks (11 and 2) and Darren Bravo (18 and 2) did not contribute much either. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-28-19/news_big_images/506850_62054812.jpg,Cricket,"India won the first test by 318 runs, with West Indies dismissed for 222 in the first innings before making only 100 in their second knock.",positive

Myanmar filmmaker jailed for one year after criticising military,"
YANGON (AFP) - A Myanmar filmmaker was sentenced to a year in prison on Thursday for criticising the military, as free expression advocates warned of ""grave threats"" to those who challenge the powerful armed forces.
Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi, an activist and founder of human rights film festivals, was detained in April following a Facebook post in which he slammed the 2008 military-drafted constitution.
The charter is deeply unpopular in Myanmar as it gifts the armed services three-quarters of parliamentary seats and control of three ministries despite an ostensible transition to civilian rule.
He was sentenced under a law that criminalises incitement by publishing statements causing ""fear or alarm"" to the public.
""I wasn’t surprised because I expected what was coming,"" Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi told reporters as he was led from the Insein courthouse in Yangon.
The ruling will take into account time served since his arrest.
The free expression group Article 19 said the case was further evidence of the ""grave threats faced by those who criticise the Myanmar military"".
""The conviction... demonstrates the extreme vulnerability of outspoken activists and artists in contemporary Myanmar,"" said Matthew Bugher, head of Article 19’s Asia programme.
Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi was one of a number of activists arrested in recent months in cases that flew under the radar after the high-profile release from jail of Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo in May.
He was sentenced in the same place where the two reporters were convicted in 2018 of violating state secrets after revealing a massacre of Rohingya Muslims.
They were freed by presidential pardon after spending more than 500 days in jail.
The Reuters case further damaged the legacy of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has gone from icon to pariah for failing to stand up for the persecuted Rohingya.

Straight outta Karachi: Pakistan's surprise hip hop hub,"
KARACHI (AFP) - Haunted by gang violence and poverty for decades, Lyari was once considered one of Pakistan’s most dangerous areas, but those grim realities also inspired a generation of artists and spawned a burgeoning hip hop scene.
With its close proximity to the sea and history of smuggling, the largely ethnic Balochi neighbourhood in Karachi stands apart for its history of violence and lawlessness -- even by Pakistan’s standards.
Heavily armed gangs and political hit squads exerted iron-fisted control over large swathes of Lyari, squashing economic growth while residents battled with the fallout, including rampant drug abuse and poverty.
In recent years, the gangs have been brought to heel following a heavy-handed operation by paramilitary forces that kicked off in 2013 and saw the streets turned into virtual war zones.
In the battle for Lyari, gangs infamously used rocket propelled grenades and assault rifles to fight security forces, with the crossfire shuttering schools and businesses and also keeping kids off the streets.
""Children used to cry listening to the fierce gunfire,"" says Omar, adding: ""The poor people were the victims of those gang wars. We witnessed all those things.""

‘Showing reality’ 


But the worst of the violence has abated, and an increase in security has led to flowering creativity.
The embattled neighbourhood now clings fiercely to its reputation for producing top footballers, iron-chinned boxers, and most recently socially conscious rappers.
The rise of hip hop in Lyari mirrors the genre’s own birth decades ago in New York’s Bronx borough, where it largely centred around street performances and featured lyrics that addressed social ills and life in urban ghettos.
Hip hop became a global phenomenon, but the genre initially failed to generate much traction in Pakistan where music fans tended to listen to pop, Bollywood soundtracks or traditional Sufi music.
The occasional forays by Pakistani musicians into hip hop over the years largely served as interludes in pop songs that veered closer to comedy.
Not so in Lyari where rappers were influenced by the likes of Tupac Shakur and looked to their own experiences for lyrical inspiration.
""In other cities and provinces, there’s rap but it’s mostly about beautiful women and luxury cars,"" says producer Qammar Anwar Baloch.



""We are showing reality.""
This artistic expression with a bass line first burst onto the nation’s airwaves in 2017 following the release of the hit song and video ""The Players of Lyari"" by the Lyari Underground.
The anthem doubles as an ode to the neighbourhood’s love for football in cricket-obsessed Pakistan along with a fiery rant lambasting the country’s sporting authorities for neglecting the neighbourhood’s football talent.
""The young people in Lyari represent one of the first times in Pakistani history where kids from the working classes are contributing to the music that upper classes listen to as well,"" explains writer Ahmer Naqvi.
""They’re using this moment to sort of assert their own place within Pakistani society, to not be content with being on the margins,"" he adds.

Digital underground 


For years, their voices and stories were largely invisible in Pakistan.
With little performance space available Lyari’s rappers have largely turned to the internet to share their clips of their songs, which generate millions of views online.
""I want to highlight the issues in Karachi and my own area in Lyari,"" explains eight-year-old rapper Waqas Baloch, who released a video under the moniker Thousand earlier this summer.
The young MC is just one of dozens of rappers to pick up a microphone in recent years, according to residents following the scene closely.
For cleric Jameel Ahmed -- who runs a madrassa in Lyari -- youth interest in music and personal expression is a welcome relief after years of tough times.
""It is far better than drugs, booze and other such menaces. Music is helping them stay away from such things,"" says Ahmed.
He adds: ""Now, their minds are opening up."" ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507099_88660479.jpg,entertainment,"

Venice film festival opens under cloud of controversy,"
VENICE (AFP) - A glittering array of A-listers swept up the red carpet as the Venice film festival opened in a flurry celebrity Wednesday, but the 11-day celebration of cinema is battling scandal over the inclusion of director Roman Polanski.
The festival, which has become the launchpad for the Oscar race, has a host of Hollywood heavyweights in a line-up including Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep and Scarlett Johansson.
But as stars arrived for the gala launch, the world s oldest film festival was already embroiled in controversy.
Venice, facing criticism for having just two films directed by women out of 21 in the running for its top prize, has sparked further fury with the films it has chosen.
Campaigners have accused the festival of being out of touch in the era of #MeToo by including Polanski. It is also presenting a new film in a sidebar event from director Nate Parker, who was embroiled in a rape trial while still at university.
Festival director Alberto Barbera defended his decision to include Polanski, calling him ""one of the last masters still active in European cinema"", at an opening press conference for the festival dominated by the issue.
He ""never had doubts"" about including Polanski s film, he said, adding ""we have to distinguish between the art and the man"" when judging the works of the filmmaker, who was convicted for the statutory rape of a 13-year-old in 1978.
But Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel, president of the judging panel for this year s Golden Lion top award, said the inclusion of Polanski had made her ""uncomfortable"", adding she would not attend the official celebration for his film.
Martel later released a statement through the festival saying that she had been misunderstood and stressed that she was not against the film being in competition.
""I have no prejudice against the film and naturally I will watch it in the same way as all other films in competition,"" she said.
The 76th Venice festival opened with the premier of Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda s ""The Truth"", with French stars Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binoche, about an actress whose decision to publish her memoirs prompts a mother-daughter reunion which turns fiery.
Binoche arrived for the screening wearing a sweeping pastel gown, accompanied on the red carpet by Deneuve in a vampy orange high-collar jacket.
The festival s blockbuster centrepiece is likely to be the new DC Comics ""The Joker"" starring Joaquin Phoenix, which traces the origins of Batman s nemesis
Trailers for the film have already been viewed more than 80 million times.
Among the other potential Oscar hopefuls at the festival, US director Steven Soderbergh s take on the Panama Papers investigation, ""The Laundromat"", is set to premier, while Brad Pitt plays an astronaut in James Gray s highly anticipated sci-fi drama ""Ad Astra"".
Saudi Arabia s Haifaa al-Mansour, the maker of the acclaimed ""Wadjda"", is one of the two women directors vying for the top prize.
Her film ""The Perfect Candidate"" tells the story of a doctor trying to become her town s first female candidate in elections in the conservative kingdom.
Newcomer Shannon Murphy is the other female contender, with her Australian comedy-drama ""Babyteeth"".
Barbera, who is credited with revitalising the festival -- first held in 1932 -- stressed that half the members of the selection panel for this year s films were women, adding ""there was no prejudice on our behalf"".
Polanski s historical thriller about the persecution of the French Jewish army officer Alfred Dreyfus, ""An Officer and a Spy"", is due to premier Friday.
The 86-year-old, who is suing the Academy of Motion Pictures for stripping him of his membership, will not appear in Venice, representatives for the film told AFP.
Deneuve has often defended the director, saying in a recent interview with AFP that the criticisms of him were ""totally excessive"". ""Time has passed,"" she added.
Meanwhile, Spike Lee has said he will travel to Venice to support Parker, whose film ""American Skin"" tells the story of a Marine veteran whose son is killed by police.
Parker 2016 debut film about a slave revolt, ""The Birth of a Nation"", was derailed after it emerged that he was accused of raping a fellow student, who later killed herself.
Parker was acquitted, but he later said, ""I look back on that time as a teenager and can say without hesitation that I should have used more wisdom.""
The festival opens as the accusations that sparked America s #MeToo movement are back in the spotlight.
Harvey Weinstein, once one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, pleaded not guilty to two new charges of sexual predatory assault Monday, as a judge postponed his trial to 2020.

LAHORE (Dunya News) – Pakistani star Mehwish Hayat took a dig at India again for its hypocrisy when Bollywood stole the music of popular “Gore Rang Ka Zamana” of Vital Signs in its new “Prada” song featuring Alia Bhatt.

Mehwish Hayat took Twitter and expressed, ““I find this strange. On the one hand Bollywood vilifies Pakistan with every opportunity they get,” the Punjab Nahi Jaungi actress shared. “On the other, they continue to steal our songs without so much as an acknowledgment. Copyright violation and royalty payments obviously mean nothing,” she concluded.

Earlier, Chhalawa star said that Bollywood could have used cinema to promote mutual understanding instead of vilifying Pakistan as they do. “They need to decide which is more important - nationalistic fervour or a peaceful future,” she expressed.

Hayat maintained her stance in an opinion piece written for CNN earlier. ""Indian PM Modi has arguably co-opted and weaponised the country’s film industry. It’s difficult, often impossible, for Pakistani actors to find work in India,"" she wrote.
""Pakistan is a Muslim majority nation and Islamophobia is a top-down industry in India: at the top, hyper-nationalist films, songs and slogans teach the masses to hate. At the grassroots, Muslims have been killed for so-called crimes like eating beef,"" Hayat said.

"Battle of the Bands: Auj earns music album contract, lifetime royalties winning season 4","
LAHORE (Dunya News) – After a two month long music battle between different bands in the Pepsi Battle of the Bands season 4, Auj were crowned as the winner beating rival band Aarish in the finale on August 23.
Co-host Hina Altaf after an eternity of anticipation announced that Auj took Rs5 million, an album contract and lifetime royalties of the original songs they performed during the course of the season four.
Aarish, the ever-competitive runner-up, proved to be a more than worthy opponent for Auj. For their incredible journey and effort and talent, they took home Rs2.5 million  and an album contract.

According to the OyeYeah, during the episode, after entire Pakistan had voted to make their favorite band be crowned the Pepsi throne, our finalists stepped foot in the battlefield one last time to entertain the crowd on the grand blue stage. But before that, the grand finale held a ton of other surprise performances for the audience.
Moving forward, families of Aarish band members, recounted their childhood anecdotes. The band members, then, also traced through their whole journey going back to Pepsi Battle of the Bands season two, and performed for the last time this season on the stage. Their original ‘Pukaar’ earned them their last standing ovation of the season and Aarish went out with a bang.

After establishing a theatrical tradition on Pepsi Battle of the Bands with ‘Mein’ last year, Meesha Shafi returned to follow up on it with a performance of ‘Leela’. The word ‘Leela’, as Shafi explained, comes from Sanskrit and the poetry revolves around a conversation between a girl and the moon. Staying true to the poetic essence of the verses, the performance was as dreamy as they come with Shafi’s costume right out of a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film.

Then, Auj band members’ families talked about their stories and struggles and Auj’s incredible rise. The finalist band then performed their original called ‘Aansu’ as the last performance of this season, which again earned them a standing ovation.

Now, of course, it couldn’t be Pepsi Battle of the Bands finale without having Fawad Khan perform. And that’s what he did, bringing his old EP gang back including Xulfi. They performed a song called ‘”Uth Jaag” which narrated a conversation an individual and time itself. Perhaps the best way to describe the performance would be ‘timeless’.

Speaking of timeless, the veterans of the industry, the timeless duo of Bilal Maqsood and Faisal Kapadia, Strings performed a new original called ‘Hum Aaye’ in what was the episode last performance. And was a way to end the season.
The hosts called on stage the marketing director of PepsiCo Saad Munawar to share a few words and award the trophy to the winner. He spoke of the need to produce original music in Pakistan and how Pepsi is serving that purpose.
With Auj being crowned the Pepsi Battle of the Bands season four winner, they join a prestigious lineup of previous crown-bearers in Aaroh, Kashmir, and Bayaan.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-27-19/news_big_images/506814_21074566.jpg,entertainment,"The band members, then, also traced through their whole journey going back to Pepsi Battle of the Bands season two, and performed for the last time this season on the stage.",positive

NEW JERSEY (Reuters) - Taylor Swift won video of the year and Ariana Grande was voted artist of the year in a girl-powered MTV Video Music Awards (VMA) show while rapper Cardi B won best hip-hop video and newcomer Lizzo celebrated large women.
Alternative pop singer Billie Eilish, 17, beat Lizzo to be named both best new artist and best breakthrough or PUSH artist in the fan-voted awards show.
Another newcomer, Lil Nas X, took home the song of the year award for ""Old Town Road,"" his country rap collaboration with Billy Ray Cyrus that ruled for a record 19 consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard singles chart.
Swift and Grande went into the ceremony in Newark, New Jersey, with a leading 10 nominations each.
With Grande on tour in Europe and absent from Monday’s show, Swift provided the opening act with a rainbow-themed performance of her pro-LGBTQ single ""You Need to Calm Down"" from her new, and already best-selling, album ""Lover.""
Accepting the video of the year award, Swift said that since the VMAs are chosen by fans, ""It means that you want a world where we are all treated equally under the law.""
""You Need to Calm Down"" also brought the country-turned-pop singer the ""video for good"" statuette for songs that have raised awareness.
Cardi B beat out a male-dominated lineup to win best hip-hop video for ""Money,"" and ended a delighted acceptance speech saying: ""Thank you, Jesus.""
The outspoken rapper was also on hand to present Missy Elliott with this year’s Vanguard Award for career achievement, calling her ""a champion for women who want to be doing their own thing.""
Best new artist contender Lizzo, enjoying a breakout year, performed her hits ""Truth Hurts"" and ""Good as Hell"" in a yellow sequined bodysuit, accompanied by plus-size dancers, in a message for body positivity.
Mendes and Camila Cabello stoked reports that they are dating with a steamy live version of their romantic duet ""Senorita,"" which reached No. 1 this week on the Billboard singles charts. The duet won the statuette for best collaboration.
Korean boy band BTS won for best K-Pop and best group, while the recently reunited Jonas Brothers, won best pop song for ""Sucker"" and paid tribute to their New Jersey roots with a performance from Asbury Park.
Monday’s VMAs had none of the stunts and draw-dropping moments that have become milestones in pop culture, including Madonna’s onstage smooch with Britney Spears in 2003, and Kanye West storming the stage in 2009 to tell Swift that her award should have gone to Beyonce. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-27-19/news_big_images/506800_74615694.jpg,entertainment,"

Researchers: Websites infected iPhones with spyware,"
(AP) - Suspected nation-state hackers used malware-laden websites to infect iPhones with spyware in what security researchers are calling the worst general security failure yet affecting the Apple devices.
Announced late Thursday by Google researchers, the vulnerabilities were quietly fixed by Apple in February but only after thousands of iPhone users were believed exposed over more than two years.
The researchers did not say who was behind the cyberespionage or what population was targeted but experts said the operation had the hallmarks of a nation-state effort.
Sensitive data accessed by the spyware included WhatsApp, iMessage and Telegram text messages, Gmail, photos, contacts and real-time location — essentially all the databases on the victim’s phone. While the messaging applications may encrypt data in transit, it is readable at rest on iPhones.
“This is definitely the most serious iPhone hacking incident that’s ever been brought to public attention, both because of the indiscriminate targeting and the amount of data compromised by the implant,” said former U.S. government hacker Jake Williams, the president of Rendition Security.
Google researcher Ian Beer said in a blog posted late Thursday that the discovery should dispel any notion that it costs a million dollars to successfully hack an iPhone. That’s a reference to the case of a United Arab Emirates dissident whose iPhone was infected in 2016 with so-called zero-day exploits, which have been known to fetch such high prices.
“Zero day” refers to the fact that such exploits are unknown to the developers of the affected software, and thus they have had no time to develop patches to fix it.
The discovery was made by Google researchers at Project Zero, which hunts security vulnerabilities in software and microprocessor firmware, independent of their manufacturer, that criminals, state-sponsored hackers and intelligence agencies use.
“This should serve as a wake-up call to folks,” said Will Strafach, a mobile security expert with Sudo Security. “Anyone on any platform could potentially get infected with malware.”
Beer said his team estimated that the infected websites used in the “indiscriminate watering hole attacks” receive thousands of visitors per week. He said the team collected five separate chains of exploits covering Apple’s iOS system as far back as version 10, released in 2016.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why it did not detect the vulnerabilities on its own and if it can assure users that such a general attack could not happen again. Privacy assurance is central to the Apple brand.
Neither Google nor Beer responded immediately to questions about the attackers or the targets, though Beer provided a hint in his blog post: “To be targeted might mean simply being born in a certain geographic region or being part of a certain ethnic group.”
Williams, of Rendition Security, said the spyware implant wasn’t written to transmit stolen data securely, suggesting an authoritarian state was behind it. He speculated that it was likely used to target political dissidents. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-30-19/news_big_images/507358_43241287.jpg,Technology,"Neither Google nor Beer responded immediately to questions about the attackers or the targets, though Beer provided a hint in his blog post: “To be targeted might mean simply being born in a certain geographic region or being part of a certain ethnic group.”

Huawei wants to build first fiber-optic cable between South America and Asia,"
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd said on Wednesday it was “very actively” interested in building the first undersea fiber-optic cable between South America and Asia.
David Dou Yong, Huawei’s chief executive in Chile, told Reuters the company was eagerly following the public tender process initiated by Chile in July and would participate when bids were invited for the trans-Pacific construction.
“Huawei will be very actively participating in this business opportunity,” he said in an interview.
“This bidding process has several steps ... We are ready and we will follow the process until the bid to select a vendor to implement it starts and for sure we will be part of the tender process.”
His comments came two months after another Chinese telecoms firm, Hengtong Optic-Electric Co Ltd, said in a filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange that it had signed a letter of intent with Huawei to buy its 51% stake in Huawei Marine Systems Co Ltd, the company’s submarine cable business, via cash and share issuance.
The move would represent Huawei’s first major asset sale since the United States ratcheted up accusations the Chinese firm is a vehicle for espionage, raising doubts about undersea cable construction projects Huawei has interests in around the world.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration effectively blacklisted Huawei in mid-May, alleging it was involved in activities that compromise U.S. national security, a charge the company has denied.
Asked for clarification about the reported sale of the submarine cable business and its implications, the company’s head of public affairs Weiqiang Zou said the deal was not confirmed.
“This is something that came out a few months ago but it is not confirmed and there is no final decision,” he said.
On Wednesday Huawei launched a data center with locally-hosted cloud storage services in Santiago, an investment of more than $100 million.
Huawei has lobbied the Chilean government to store its data in the cloud.
Documents reviewed by Reuters show that in the past three years, senior Huawei executives have held dozens of meetings with city mayors and government ministers and officials from the Chilean police, its central bank, its tax authority, its army, the state development agency and the ministries of mining, health, economy, transport, energy and interior to lobby for cloud computing and facial recognition software technology.
Dou Yong told Reuters there were no agreements in place with government yet but that Huawei would keep pressing for state business.
“We look on Chile as the benchmark for the whole of Latin America,” he said.

"Tesla's Musk, Alibaba's Ma talk aliens and AI, skip issues like trade","
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Alibaba founder Jack Ma discussed Mars and artificial intelligence but steered clear of the U.S.-China trade war in their first joint appearance on Thursday that some audience members said was disappointing.
Their chat, which was livestreamed, was part of the opening events for the annual World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai.
When the scheduled conversation by the tycoons was first announced, speculation was rife that they could use the podium to talk about issues such as the U.S.-China trade frictions, which both had previously publicly commented on, a factory Tesla is building in Shanghai, or Ma’s impending retirement from Alibaba.
But the duo avoided all mention of those issues, instead chatting for over half an hour about their vision of how technology, especially artificial intelligence, will shape the future.
“I’m always amazed by your vision of technology, I’m not a tech guy,” Ma said in his first remarks to Musk, before going on to talk about how artificial intelligence was not a threat.
Ma described himself as “optimistic” about AI’s impact on humanity, adding that people who worry too much about it have what he calls “college smartness”. “People like us that are street smart, we’re not scared of that.”
They also went on to talk about space travel, with Ma complimenting Musk on his attempts to journey into Mars via SpaceX while Musk noted China’s advancements in that area, as well as how “inadequate” humans were against computers.
Musk did not make any announcements on his underground tunneling enterprise, The Boring Company, although he had tweeted earlier this month that he would launch a China unit at the WAIC. He told Reuters after his chat with Ma that it could “hopefully” still happen, without elaborating.
Tech employee Simon Zhang, who was in the audience, told Reuters he left with the impression that Musk, who arrived in Shanghai in the morning, was suffering from jet lag.
“The conversation was not as exciting as I expected,” he said. “They were each talking about their own separate topics.”
Another audience member, who gave his name as Cheney, expressed similar disappointment. “People were looking forward to this. But what Musk said about artificial intelligence he has said millions of times before, and Jack Ma was just being Jack Ma.”
Chinese website Sina Technology in a post on the country’s Twitter-like Weibo service noted that Musk at times appeared at a loss for words.
“The opening of the ‘Double Ma Meeting’ was a bit cold,” it said, referring to the Mandarin Chinese translation of Musk’s name.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507124_89045048.jpg,Technology,"“I’m always amazed by your vision of technology, I’m not a tech guy,” Ma said in his first remarks to Musk, before going on to talk about how artificial intelligence was not a threat.",negative

Apple's data shows a deepening dependence on China as Trump's tariffs loom,"
(Reuters) - Tapping factories in Brazil and India has not lessened Apple Inc’s dependence on China, the company’s supply chain data shows, raising the stakes for the iPhone maker as U.S. President Donald Trump wages a trade war and promises more tariffs.
Apple faces levies of 15% imposed by Trump’s administration on major products made in China such as smartwatches and wireless headphones on Sept. 1, with a tariff on its biggest seller, the iPhone, to take effect on Dec. 15.
Few American firms are as tightly bound to Asia’s largest economy as Apple. Contract factories owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd’s Foxconn, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and others employ hundreds of thousands of workers to assemble Apple devices.
In recent years, Apple’s contract manufacturers have expanded into other countries. India, for example, had no Apple contract manufacturer locations in 2015 but expanded to three assembly facilities by 2019, including a factory owned by Foxconn, which plans to make models from the iPhone X family of devices, Reuters reported last year. 
Apple taps the India operations to avoid steep import duties on iPhones in one of the last fast-growing mobile phone markets on the planet, similar to Apple and Foxconn’s move to open a production facility in Brazil in 2011.
But the factories outside China are smaller and, in the case of India and Brazil, Apple only uses them to meet domestic demand. Apple’s contract factories inside China, meanwhile, have added far more locations than outside, with Foxconn alone expanding from 19 locations in 2015 to 29 in 2019 and Pegatron going from eight to 12, according to Apple’s data.
The new locations come as Apple has added watches, smart speakers and wireless headphones to its product lineup.
And beyond the contract factories, the rest of Apple’s suppliers - the companies that sell it chips, glass, aluminium casings, cables, circuit boards and much more - became more concentrated in China. Among all supplier locations, 44.9% were in China in 2015, a proportion that rose to 47.6% by 2019, the data showed.
Reuters analysed five years’ worth of supply chain data published by Apple. The data includes more than 750 locations each year between 2015 and 2019 for the California company’s top 200 suppliers based on Apple’s spending. Apple does not disclose how much it spends with each, and the companies on the list can change as different suppliers make the top-200 cutoff among Apple’s thousands of suppliers.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507053_22877306.jpg,Technology,"Apple taps the India operations to avoid steep import duties on iPhones in one of the last fast-growing mobile phone markets on the planet, similar to Apple and Foxconn’s move to open a production facility in Brazil in 2011.",neutral
Huawei plans high-end phone launch under cloud of Google ban,"
NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies plans to forge ahead with the launch of new high-end smartphones in Europe even though it may not be able to offer Google’s official Android operating system and widely used apps such as Google Maps, company executives told Reuters.
The world’s No. 2 smartphone maker is set to unveil its new Mate 30 line of phones on Sept. 18 in Munich, according to a source familiar with the matter, though it is not clear when the devices would go on sale.
The Mate 30, made to work on new 5G mobile networks, is Huawei’s first major flagship smartphone launch since U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration effectively blacklisted the company in mid-May, alleging it is involved in activities that compromise U.S. national security, a charge the company denies.
A Google spokesman told Reuters the Mate 30 cannot be sold with licensed Google apps and services due to the U.S. ban on sales to Huawei. A temporary reprieve that the U.S. government announced last week does not apply to new products such as the Mate 30, the spokesman said.
U.S. companies can seek a license for specific products to be exempted from the ban. Google, a part of Alphabet Inc, would not say whether it had applied for a license to offer its apps and services known as Google Mobile Services, though it has said in the past that it wants to continue supplying Huawei.
Reuters reported this week that the U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to Huawei, but none have been granted.
The uncertainty surrounding the Mate 30 shows the confusion that reigns for Huawei and its business partners as a result of the escalating trade war between China and the United States. While the Huawei blacklisting was cast as a response to security concerns, President Trump has indicated it could be lifted as part of a trade deal.
“Huawei will continue to use the Android OS and ecosystem if the U.S. government allows us to do so,” Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly told Reuters. “Otherwise, we will continue to develop our own operating system and ecosystem.”
The Commerce Department declined to comment.

NO GOOGLE, NO SALES?

Huawei can likely use an open-source version of Android without falling foul of the U.S. ban on sales to them. But Google’s apps can only be used in Europe under a paid license from the search giant. There is no fee for the license outside of Europe.
“Without Google Services, no one will buy the device,” said independent analyst Richard Windsor. The Google software normally comes pre-loaded on Android devices.
Huawei earlier this month announced its own mobile operating system, dubbed Harmony. But analysts and Huawei executives are skeptical that it is yet a viable alternative to Android.
Huawei vaulted quickly into the top ranks of the global smartphone business in recent years with highly regarded hardware, and Europe has been a key market.
But the U.S. ban has dealt a body blow to sales outside of China, with Huawei’s market share in Europe sliding to 19.3% in the second quarter from 24.9% in the first, figures from Counterpoint Research show.
As late as last week, senior Huawei executives struck a confident tone regarding Android and Google.
“Our new phones will still be based on Android,” Vincent Pang, senior vice president and board director of Huawei, told a media gathering at the top of New York City’s One World Trade Center, an iconic American symbol of perseverance.
“We want to maintain one standard, one ecosystem, one technology,” he said.

CHIPS IN THE CLEAR

Huawei is confident that other hardware in the new phone will be compliant with U.S. law.
The brains of the Mate 30 line, the Kirin 990 chipset, will be formally unveiled on Sept. 6 by Richard Yu, Huawei’s top consumer executive, when he gives the opening keynote address at the IFA consumer tech fair in Berlin.
The Kirin 990 was developed by HiSilicon, Huawei’s chips unit, based on blueprints from British chip designer ARM Holdings, owned by Japan’s SoftBank.
ARM severed relations with Huawei after the U.S. ban because its designs contain technology of U.S. origin. But a source familiar with Huawei’s plan said its ARM license is based on work that predated the blacklisting of Huawei.
Huawei last week said it has perpetual ownership of the ARMv8 license and chips based on it, including the Kirin 990, would not be affected by the ban.
ARM declined to comment on its relationship with Huawei, saying only that “ARM continues to remain compliant with the latest U.S. Commerce Department restrictions and we are adhering to the guidelines related to the specific types of conversations permitted, technical or otherwise.”",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-29-19/news_big_images/507050_34172314.jpg,Technology,"Google, a part of Alphabet Inc, would not say whether it had applied for a license to offer its apps and services known as Google Mobile Services, though it has said in the past that it wants to continue supplying Huawei.",negative
Facebook acknowledges flaw in Messenger Kids app,"
(Reuters) - Facebook Inc acknowledged a flaw in its Messenger Kids app, weeks after two U.S. senators raised privacy concerns about the application, and said that it spoke to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about the matter.
“We are in regular contact with the FTC on many issues and products, including Messenger Kids,” Facebook Vice President Kevin Martin wrote in a letter to two Democrats, which is seen by Reuters. He described the flaw as a “technical error”.
The letter dated Aug. 27 was sent to Democratic Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.
“Based on our review, we have determined that the technical error you have inquired above arose in October 2018. The fix we implemented is designed to prevent the issue from happening again,” Facebook said in the letter.
The senators said on Wednesday they were disappointed by Facebook’s approach on the matter.
“We are particularly disappointed that Facebook did not commit to undertaking a comprehensive review of Messenger Kids to identify additional bugs or privacy issues,” Markey and Blumenthal said in response to Facebook’s letter.
The senators had written to Facebook on Aug. 6 questioning whether there was a “worrying pattern” of poor privacy protection for children using the Messenger Kids app and sought transparency.
The senators were “disturbed” to learn that the application allowed thousands of children to join group chats in which not all members of the group were approved by their parents, they said in the letter to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.
In July, Facebook agreed to pay a record $5 billion fine to resolve an FTC probe into its privacy practices and will boost safeguards on user data.
FTC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular business hours.

Google to move Pixel smartphone production to Vietnam,"
(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google is shifting its Pixel smartphone production to Vietnam from China starting this year as it builds a cheap supply chain in Southeast Asia, the Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday.
The move comes as labor costs are rising in China along with added pressure from spiraling tariffs due to the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade tensions.
The U.S. internet giant plans to move most of its American-bound hardware out of China, including the Pixel phones and its smart speaker Google Home, Nikkei said.
The company plans to ship about 8 million to 10 million smartphones this year, double from a year ago, making Vietnam a key part of Google’s drive for growth in the smartphone market, the newspaper added.
Google will shift some production of the Pixel 3A phone to Vietnam before the end of this year, Nikkei reported citing sources.
For its smart speakers, some production is likely to be moved to Thailand but the company’s new product development and initial production for its hardware lineup will still be in China, the newspaper said.

Researchers studying Facebook's impact on democracy threaten to quit,"
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A group of philanthropies working with Facebook Inc to study the social network’s impact on democracy threatened on Tuesday to quit, saying the company had failed to make data available to researchers as pledged.
The funders said in a statement that Facebook had granted the 83 scholars selected for the project access to “only a portion of what they were told they could expect,” which made it impossible for some to carry out their research. They have given Facebook until Sept. 30 to provide the data.
Their concerns focus on the absence of data that would show which web pages were shared on Facebook as far back as January 2017.
The company had yet to say when the data would be made available, the funders added.
Facebook said in a statement that it remained committed to the project and would “continue to provide access to data and tooling to all grant recipients - current and future.”
The announcement comes only a few months after Facebook launched the research program, which opened the company’s propriety data to independent scholars for the first time.
Data access was meant to be heavily controlled, with special precautions to protect user privacy.
The funding consortium includes both the conservative Charles Koch Foundation and Silicon Valley’s Omidyar Network.
“We hope Facebook (not to mention other platform companies) will find a way to provide deeply robust privacy-protected data,” they said, as “independent scholarly analysis of social media platforms is essential” to understanding elections and democracy around the world.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-28-19/news_big_images/506860_35567141.jpg,Technology,"Facebook said in a statement that it remained committed to the project and would “continue to provide access to data and tooling to all grant recipients - current and future.”

"Ousting Huawei, Australia finishes laying undersea internet cable for Pacific allies","
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The final piece of Australia’s A$137 million ($92.53 million) undersea cable to bring high-speed internet to the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea was laid on Wednesday, with Canberra seeking to repulse Chinese influence in the Pacific.
Australia in 2018 agreed to fund the construction of the cable after the two Pacific islands struck deals with China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to lay a cable via Sydney - which Canberra feared could have jeopardized its broadband network.
Huawei denies its equipment provides an opportunity for foreign espionage.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the infrastructure, known as the Coral Sea Cable, will cement Canberra’s ties with the Pacific - a region that Australia worries is being swayed by China’s increased foreign aid to the region.
“The cable is so practical, so important and so emblematic of the relationship between Australia and our key partners in the Pacific,” Payne told reporters in Sydney.
“The Coral Sea Cable will deliver for Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands a connected future, Payne said, adding that the aim was for the cable to be operational by December.
China denies using economic aid as political leverage, insisting it considers the ability of a country to repay loans when offering finance.
In a bid to counter China, Australia has offered A$3 billion ($2.03 billion) in cheap loans and grants to the Pacific.
The competition for influence in the Pacific has soured bilateral relations between Australia and China.
The relationship came under further strain on Tuesday when China confirmed it has formally arrested a Chinese-born Australian writer on suspicion of espionage.
Yang Hengjun, a former Chinese diplomat turned online journalist and blogger, was detained in January.
Payne on Tuesday said Australia held grave concerns about Yang and the “harsh” conditions he is being held in.
The comments were immediately rebuked by China, which called on Australia to respect China’s judicial sovereignty.

SpaceX's Mars rocket prototype rattles nerves of nearby residents in Texas flight test,"
(Reuters) - SpaceX test-launched an early prototype of the company’s Mars rocket on Tuesday, rattling the nerves of people living near the Texas site and clearing another key hurdle in billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s interplanetary ambitions.
The prototype, dubbed Starhopper, slowly rose about 500 feet (152m) off its launch pad in Brownsville, Texas, and propelled itself some 650 feet (198m) eastward onto an adjacent landing platform, completing a seemingly successful low-altitude test of SpaceX’s next-generation Raptor engine.
The Raptor is designed to power Musk’s forthcoming heavy-lift Starship rocket, a reusable two-stage booster taller than the Statue of Liberty that is expected to play a central role in Musk’s interplanetary space travel objectives, including missions to Mars.
The prototype “hopper” vehicle, resembling a chrome water tower with four landing legs, was originally slated for its test liftoff on Monday. But a “rather embarrassing” wiring issue with the single Raptor engine halted the countdown less than a second before ignition, Musk, the SpaceX founder and chief executive, said on Twitter.
About a dozen people living in the adjacent village of Boca Chica, just over a mile from the test site, had been urged in advance by local authorities to vacate their homes as a precaution at the sound of police sirens that blared minutes before launch.
“It almost looked like a cartoon or something,” nearby resident Cheryl Stevens told Reuters just after Starhopper’s flight. “After all the buildup, it was kind of nice to actually see it happen.”
The notices, circulated by sheriff’s deputies three days in advance, warned of a possible “overpressure event” that could shatter windows and endanger anyone remaining inside their homes in the event of an explosive malfunction.
Maria Pointer, another resident, set up cameras and invited photographers to her home. She said excitement surrounding the launch reminded her of “feeling like you’re going on a Ferris wheel.”
Other residents bemoaned SpaceX’s presence on the Texas coast, frustrated with road closures and confusing public notices worrisome to those unaccustomed to the trials of spaceflight experimentation.
“It’s kind of like a double-edged sword,” said resident Terry Heaton, adding that access to the nearby beach was blocked off every time SpaceX attempted an engine test.
The next step for Raptor will be to carry out additional ground-based firings of the engine bolted to a stationary test stand, Musk said.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-28-19/news_big_images/506854_54828018.jpg,Technology,"“It’s kind of like a double-edged sword,” said resident Terry Heaton, adding that access to the nearby beach was blocked off every time SpaceX attempted an engine test.",positive
EU's antitrust chief checking if Google favors own job search tool,"
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators are checking Google for Jobs to see if the company unfairly favors its fast-growing tool for searching job listings, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Tuesday.
Launched two years ago, the tool has already drawn numerous complaints from rivals alleging anti-competitive behavior.
Earlier this month, 23 job search websites in Europe urged the European Commission to temporarily order Google to stop such practices while it investigates the issue.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has handed out 8.25 billion euros ($9.2 billion) in fines to the tech giant in recent years in three separate cases, voiced concerns about the possibility of similar anti-competitive practices by Alphabet unit Google in other areas.
“And we’re looking right now at whether the same thing may have happened with other parts of Google’s business – like the job search business known as Google for Jobs,” Vestager told a conference in Berlin.
She said the European Commission may adopt rules to rein in tech giants if they do not play fair.
“There’s also a broader issue for our societies, of whether we think it’s right for companies like Google and others to have such control over the success or failure of other companies, and be free to use that power in any way they like,” she said.
“If we don’t, then we may find that we need regulation, to make sure that these platforms use their power in a way that’s fair and doesn’t discriminate,” Vestager said. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-27-19/news_big_images/506799_88127976.jpg,Technology,"“There’s also a broader issue for our societies, of whether we think it’s right for companies like Google and others to have such control over the success or failure of other companies, and be free to use that power in any way they like,” she said.",positive
Driverless buses delight tourists in new Singapore test,"
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Under the sweltering Singapore sun, an autonomous shuttle bus drives up by itself and allows a line of tourists to board, providing respite from the heat as the passengers sped away in cool comfort.
The island-state - ranked second behind the United States in its preparedness for driverless vehicles - started to tentatively test a fleet of shuttles in its coastal tourist district of Sentosa this week.
After a series of mishaps at home and abroad with the new technology, the company behind the latest test said it is taking no chances. Tan Nai Kwan, chief robotics engineer at ST Engineering Land Systems, said safety was paramount during this testing phase.
""We always want to have a very safe ride for everybody. I think throughout the whole process, you have seen us, we are very concerned about safety belt, et cetera,"" said Tan.
On the first day of the trial on Monday (August 26), there were almost as many bus stewards as passengers making sure seatbelts were tightly fastened as the bus trundled through quiet roads. Meanwhile, a driver hovered above the self-rotating steering wheel at all times, ready to snatch back control.
""I have to look out for traffic, any hazards. Some drivers they violate the rules, which we need to take extra precautions, because they (don’t) know how this autonomous bus is working,"" said Muhd Faiz Bin Ahmad, one of the autonomous buses’ safety driver.
Singapore’s testing of the technology is being closely watched as tech firms and automakers race to build self-drive cars and develop new business plans for what is expected to be a long-term makeover of personal transport.
The city-state ranked No. 2 globally in an index that assesses countries’ openness and preparedness for autonomous vehicles in a recent KPMG report, although a broader roll out across the island remains years away.
Testing is not without risk. In 2016, a self-driving car being tested in Singapore collided with a truck as it was changing lanes. The were no injuries but similar accidents in the U.S. have been fatal.
But the few intrepid tourists that managed to navigate the on-demand service on the trial’s first day in Singapore did not seem phased by their robotic navigator.
""It’s pretty cool, but at the same time it feels similar to a normal bus,"" said Stephen Byrne, a 20-year old student from Ireland. ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-27-19/news_big_images/506796_97599249.jpg,Technology,"After a series of mishaps at home and abroad with the new technology, the company behind the latest test said it is taking no chances.",positive
Virtual reality helps Israeli soldiers enter new world,"
PETAH TIKVAH (AFP) - An Israeli soldier carefully eyes the narrow, damp tunnel carved from surrounding rock through a tightly strapped black headset.
He is not in one of the attack tunnels built by Lebanon’s Hezbollah under the border with Israel, but one of a new generation of soldiers using virtual and augmented reality to train.
In a small computer-lined room, T., a 20-year-old member of Yahalom, or Diamond -- the special operations unit of the army’s combat engineering corps -- simulates an advance along the narrow passage.
His head sweeps from side-to-side and up and down, while his hands probe walls invisible to the onlooker.
""We see everything, even falling drops of water,"" says the soldier, who cannot be named for security reasons.
""I really feel like I’m there,"" he told AFP. ""I feel the humidity, the sense of being stifled.""
The headset displays every detail of the virtual tunnel -- a reconstruction of one of several subterranean infiltrations uncovered by the army -- allowing instructors to guide T. in real time.
In December, the Israeli army launched an anti-tunnel operation on the Lebanese border dubbed ""Northern Shield"".
Israel said it had found six tunnels, while UN officials confirmed three reached into the Jewish state’s territory.
Hezbollah planned to use them to abduct or kill Israeli soldiers or civilians, and to seize territory in the event of hostilities, according to the military.
They ran for dozens of metres and some reached a depth of 55 metres (180 feet).
In recent days, fresh tensions have erupted between Hezbollah and Israel; the Iran-aligned Shiite movement blamed the Jewish state for a drone attack on its Beirut stronghold. Israel has not commented.
Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah called it the first such ""hostile action"" since a 2006 war between his movement and the Jewish state. He threatened retaliation.
The Israeli army is also on the lookout for tunnels dug into the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.
They are used by militants and, on the Egyptian border, smugglers trying to circumvent a blockade on the Palestinian enclave.
The Israeli army says it has destroyed several tunnels that ran into its territory and were designed as attack launchpads.
The Egyptian army has vigorously hunted for and blocked smuggling tunnels from its side of the frontier.

Technology is essential

Until recently the domain of video game creators, the virtual world has in recent years made inroads into medical, aerospace and military research, where it is increasingly used for training.
""Technology is an essential part of the fight,"" which justifies heavy investment, says H., commanding officer of Yahalom’s training centre at a military base in central Israel.
The Hezbollah tunnels exposed by Israel have been digitally scanned and appear on a soldier’s headset as they are in reality.
""The soldier sees what a tunnel looks like,"" says H.
Since it is not always possible to train in the field, the virtual world allows personnel to familiarise themselves with a hostile underground environment without leaving their base, he added.
There are a dozen soldiers on the current course; 100 have been through it since it began three years ago.
While virtual reality (VR) aims to place the person in a simulated world, augmented reality (AR) allows elements to be added in a real-world environment. Both aim to provide a multisensory experience.
Soldiers can experience scenarios where there are obstacles such as holes, cables, or explosive devices and simulate the hand movements they will need to defuse a real bomb.
""There are elements one can face in a tunnel which are difficult to reproduce,"" such as humidity, says the commander, but it serves as a good introduction to the subject.
""It’s not very nice to be dozens of metres underground, cut off from the world,"" says T. ""Anything that can help you prepare is important.
He says that the electronic training has made him ""more ready to enter a tunnel"" in real life.
Not far from the ""VR room"" is a physical mockup of a Hamas tunnel where soldiers can engage in combat exercises, polishing what they have learnt through VR.
Three soldiers make their way inside, their faces covered with balaclavas, machine guns in their hands as they move through the rock passageway, narrow and dark.  ",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-27-19/news_big_images/506772_84805525.jpg,Technology,"He is not in one of the attack tunnels built by Lebanon’s Hezbollah under the border with Israel, but one of a new generation of soldiers using virtual and augmented reality to train.",positive
More plant protein tied to longer life,"
(Reuters Health) - People who eat more plant-based protein may live longer than those who get more protein from meat, a Japanese study suggests.
Researchers followed almost 71,000 middle-aged Japanese adults for an average of almost two decades. Compared to people who consumed the smallest amount of plant protein, participants who consumed the largest amount were 13% less likely to die during the study and 16% less likely to die of cardiovascular causes.
“Previous studies have found higher consumption of animal protein is associated with increased chronic diseases and mortality, whereas higher consumption of plant protein is associated with lower risk, but most of these studies were conducted in Western populations, in which consumption of animal protein is much higher than plant protein,” said Dr. Frank Hu, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
“In this Japanese study, consumption of plant protein is quite high, whereas the consumption of animal protein is quite low compared to that in Western populations,” Hu, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.”
Animal protein didn’t appear to influence longevity in the study, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.
Overall in the study, 12,381 people died, including 5,055 fatalities from cancer, 3,025 from cardiovascular disease, 1,528 from heart disease, and 1,198 due to cerebrovascular disease.
People who replaced just 3% of red meat with plant protein were 34% less likely to die of any cause, 39% less likely to die of cancer, and 42% less likely to die of heart disease during the study.
And, people who replaced just 4% of processed meat in their diet with plant protein were 46% less likely to die of any cause and 50% less likely to die of cancer.
“When individuals eat more plant protein foods such as nuts, soy, and lentils, there is a significant improvement in cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids, blood pressure, and body weight,” Hu said.
“It is worth noting that these plant foods contain not just protein, but also other beneficial nutrients such as healthy fats, anti-oxidant vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals,” Hu added. “On the other hand, diets high in red and processed meats have been associated with a wide range of health consequences such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.”
The current study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how the amount or type of protein people consume might directly impact their longevity.
One limitation of the research is that participants’ diets were only assessed once, at the start of the study, and it’s possible their eating habits changed over time, study coauthor Dr. Norie Sawada of the National Cancer Center in Tokyo and colleagues write in their report. Sawada didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“The take-home message is that to live longer, one should swap red and processed meat with healthy, plant proteins like nuts, beans, lentils, and whole grains,” Hu advised. “Such a dietary pattern is not only beneficial for human health but also more environmentally sustainable.”",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-27-19/news_big_images/506735_58537011.jpg,Technology,"“On the other hand, diets high in red and processed meats have been associated with a wide range of health consequences such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.”

A particle accelerator simulates colliding neutron stars,"
(Web Desk) – When two neutron stars collide, it’s not like we can just pop up there with a thermometer to measure the intense temperatures being generated at the heart of the collision.
There are other observables that can help us calculate surface temperatures, but inside? That’s a little trickier.
Add to that the fact that we’ve only ever seen one neutron star collision (that we know of), it’s not like there are a bunch of opportunities on which to perfect techniques for taking the temperature of a neutron star fender bender.
So scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany (the HADES Collaboration) got creative. They figured out how to simulate a neutron star collision right here on Earth. And the answer was another type of collision - particles.
Heavy ions, to be precise. As it turns out, some of the conditions in heavy ion collisions - namely the densities and temperatures - are similar to those in neutron star collisions. And, just as virtual photons are produced in a neutron star collision, they can also appear when two heavy ions are smashed together at velocities approaching light speed.
This can be done using the GSI’s heavy ion accelerator, but there are two main problems. The first is that the virtual photons appear very rarely. The second is that they are very weak.
The first problem is easy to solve, if somewhat time consuming. You just make more collisions.
""We had to record and analyse about 3 billion collisions to finally reconstruct 20,000 measurable virtual photons,"" said TUM physicist Jürgen Friese.
The second problem is a little bit trickier. The team had to design a large custom camera - 1.5 square metres - to detect the very faint Cherenkov radiation patterns generated by the decay products of virtual photons.
These are too faint to be seen with the naked eye.
""We therefore developed a pattern recognition technique in which a 30,000 pixel photo is rastered in a few microseconds using electronic masks,"" Friese said.
""That method is complemented with neural networks and artificial intelligence.""
This data allowed the team to probe the bulk properties of the extremely dense matter briefly produced by the heavy ion collisions - and they found that it resembles the properties expected in the matter that forms during a neutron star merger.
In turn, they were able to determine that two colliding neutron stars, each with a mass 1.35 times that of the Sun, would produce a temperature of 800 billion degrees Celsius. This means that such collisions fuse heavy nuclei.
But that’s not all. This research provides insight into the dense quark matter (QCD matter) that filled the Universe just moments after the Big Bang.
""A plasma of quarks and gluons transitioned into nucleons and other hadronic bound states in the early universe,"" the researchers wrote in their paper.
""Similar states of matter, at lower temperatures, are believed still to exist in the interior of compact stellar objects, such as neutron stars. The formation of such cosmic matter in heavy-ion collisions provides access to studies of the microscopic structure of QCD matter at the femtoscale.""
The team’s research has been published in Nature Physics.

"Armed with smartphones, Myanmar e-sports players battle power outages","
YANGON (AFP) - ESports star Myint was on the cusp of victory when the screens went dark in the Yangon cafe where he competes, costing him thousands of dollars in missed prize-money and denting his reputation.
Myanmar’s gaming scene is mushrooming, but frequent power cuts are holding players back in the emerging democracy.
""Every time a black-out happens, we curse out the electricity corporation -- and it happens often,"" he told AFP.
More than 60 percent of people in Myanmar still live without reliable electricity after a political transition in 2010 that sought to pull in foreign investment after decades of junta rule.
That includes getting in on the global explosion in eSports, a billion-dollar industry that will be a medal event in the Southeast Asian Games in November for the first time.
But Myanmar is at risk of missing out with power cuts, few personal computers and a dearth of resources to support travel and competition abroad holding homegrown champions back.
Myint Myat Zaw, a 21-year-old player also known as ""Insane"", said he has lost about 40 matches due to blackouts, making it difficult to earn a slot abroad where cash prizes are now in the tens of millions of dollars.
He plays Dota 2, which in Shanghai hosted its equivalent of the champions league this weekend, boasting a record $34.3 million prize pool.
But Dota 2 tournaments are rare in Myanmar, he said, making it difficult for him to earn a living from the game.
""The last three years was the hardest period of my career...I lived in a game shop and was also short on food,"" he told AFP.

Anywhere, anytime

For gamers, a dingy internet cafe has long been the typical venue to battle it out with players from other countries.
But that has started to change as cheap SIM cards hit the markets and smartphone use soars.
Mobile penetration stood at just seven percent in 2012, but demand has skyrocketed and the figure now sits at more than 80 percent.
Players competing on mobiles can stay logged on when local grids go dark.
""We can play anywhere, anytime,"" said Myint Myat Aung, a mobile gamer who competes on PlayerUnknown’s Battleground (PUBG) for Singapore-based eSports team Impunity.
It is also cheaper.
""We only have phone bills which don’t cost very much,"" he told AFP.
Last month, Impunity, with more than 400 other teams, took part in a PUBG tournament hosted by Samsung Galaxy at a Yangon mall.
Staring into smartphones, players took down their opponents with sniper rifles, the action projected onto a large screen as spectators cheered.
The prize pool for the tournament was around $7,000, an immense sum in a country where the average income is less than $1,300 a year.
Impunity’s country manager Brian Min Sett said the increasing value of winnings was sign of growth as ""our country doesn’t have many high-prize tournaments.""
Myanmar, like other developing countries, is at ""a serious disadvantage"" compared to its neighbours, said Jeremy Jackson, market analyst for eSports reseach firm NewZoo.
""Access to stable electricity and internet are crucial when it comes to competitive gaming,"" Jackson told AFP.
""Undoubtedly, greater smartphone penetration will allow more people access to the mobile competitive gaming landscape.

Myanmar legends?

In a country that has produced few international athletic stars, eSports offers players a way into a global community and a chance to make a steady salary, especially for those competing in ultra-popular mobile games.
""They can make their own living just by competing in tournaments,"" said Kaung Myat San, co-founder of the HOG e-sports center in Yangon.
Myanmar’s sporting authorities lack funding, so HOG plans to send 16 athletes to represent Myanmar in the Southeast Asia games -- including Myint Myat Zaw, who was scooped up as a salaried player earlier this year.
Both Dota 2 and Mobile Legend - a fantasy battle game designed for smartphones with more than 3 million users in Myanmar - will be part of the competition.
After years of struggling to eke out a living playing for people wishing to boost their scores, Myint Myat Zaw said he was ""proud"" to now be representing Myanmar.
""Although there is more pressure, it makes me keen to do better,"" he said.",https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2019/August/08-27-19/news_big_images/506690_77397820.jpg,Technology,"In a country that has produced few international athletic stars, eSports offers players a way into a global community and a chance to make a steady salary, especially for those competing in ultra-popular mobile games.",positive
Spacecraft carrying Russian humanoid robot docks at ISS,"
MOSCOW (AFP) - An unmanned spacecraft carrying Russia’s first humanoid robot to be sent into orbit successfully docked at the International Space Station on Tuesday, following a failed attempt over the weekend.
""Contact confirmed, capture confirmed,"" a commentator on NASA TV said.
The lifesize robot named Fedor -- short for Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research -- copies human movements, a key skill that allows it to help carry out tasks remotely.
It blasted off Thursday in a Soyuz MS-14 spacecraft from a Russian spaceport in southern Kazakhstan and is due to stay on the ISS until September 7, learning to assist astronauts in the space station.
An aborted docking on Saturday had increased uncertainty over the future of Russia’s space programme, which has suffered a number of recent setbacks.
NASA said Saturday the craft had been ""unable to lock onto its target at the station,"" and had ""backed a safe distance away from the orbital complex while the Russian flight controllers assess the next steps"".
Russian flight controllers had told the ISS crew it appeared the problem that prevented automated docking was in the station and not the spacecraft, NASA added.
Soyuz ships are normally manned on such trips, but this time no humans were travelling in order to test a new emergency rescue system.
Fedor is not the first robot to go into space. In 2011, NASA sent up Robonaut 2, a humanoid developed with General Motors that had a similar aim of working in high-risk environments.
It was flown back to Earth in 2018 after experiencing technical problems.
In 2013, Japan sent up a small robot called Kirobo along with the ISS’s first Japanese space commander. Developed with Toyota, it was able to hold conversations -- albeit only in Japanese.
The International Space Station has been orbiting Earth at about 28,000 kilometres per hour (17,000 miles per hour) since 1998.
Last October, a Soyuz rocket carrying an American and a Russian had to make an emergency landing shortly after lift-off -- the first failure in the history of manned Russian flights.
